1
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,970
You're wondering why
I brought you all here.

2
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,420
After all,
we just had a feast.

3
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,380
Since when does
old Walder

4
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,380
give us two feasts
in a single fortnight?

5
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,840
Well, it's no good being
Lord of the Riverlands

6
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,220
if you can't celebrate
with your family.

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,720
That's what I say!

8
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,130
Yes!

9
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,880
I've gathered every Frey
who means a damn thing

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,220
so I can tell you my plans
for this great house

11
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,090
now that winter
has come.

12
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,260
But first, a toast!

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,510
No more of that
Dornish horse piss!

14
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,470
This is the finest
Arbor gold!

15
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:29,470
Proper wine
for proper heroes!

16
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,840
Stand together!

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,090
All:
Stand together!

18
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,260
Not you.

19
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,170
I'm not wasting good wine
on a damn woman.

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,220
Maybe I'm not
the most pleasant man.

21
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,630
I'll admit it.
But I'm proud of you lot.

22
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,760
You're my family,
the men who helped me

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,800
slaughter the Starks
at the Red Wedding.

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,920
Walder: Yes, yes.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,590
Cheer.

26
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,920
Brave men,
all of you.

27
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,510
Butchered a woman
pregnant with her babe.

28
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,340
Cut the throat
of a mother of five.

29
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,470
Slaughtered your guests
after inviting them

30
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,220
into your home.

31
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:41,510
But you didn't slaughter
every one of the Starks.

32
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,260
No, no, that was
your mistake.

33
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,130
You should have
ripped them all out,
root and stem.

34
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,010
Leave one wolf alive

35
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:01,670
and the sheep
are never safe.

36
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,590
When people ask you
what happened here...

37
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,880
tell them
the North remembers.

38
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,220
Tell them winter came
for House Frey.

39
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,420
You wildlings?

40
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,340
I'm Meera Reed,
daughter of Howland Reed.

41
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,840
This is Brandon Stark,

42
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,050
son of Ned Stark.

43
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,880
How do I know
that's true?

44
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,380
You were at
the Fist of the First Men.

45
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,840
You were at Hardhome.

46
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,720
You've seen
the Army of the Dead.

47
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,970
You've seen
the Night King.

48
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,050
He's coming for us.

49
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,380
For all of us.

50
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,130
Okay, come on.

51
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,220
Let's get them inside.

52
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,510
Jon: I want
every northern maester
to scour their records

53
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,670
for any mention
of dragonglass.

54
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,760
Dragonglass kills
white walkers.

55
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,420
It's more valuable
to us now than gold.

56
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,090
We need to find it,
we need to mine it,

57
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,800
we need to make
weapons from it.

58
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,130
Everyone
aged 10 to 60

59
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,380
will drill daily
with spears, pikes,
bow and arrow.

60
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,590
It's about time we taught
these boys of summer
how to fight.

61
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,880
Not just the boys.

62
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,380
We can't defend
the North

63
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,550
if only half
the population
is fighting.

64
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,260
You expect me
to put a spear in
my granddaughter's hand?

65
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,920
I don't plan
on knitting by the fire
while men fight for me.

66
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,010
I might be small, Lord Glover,
and I might be a girl,

67
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,470
but I am every bit as much
a Northerner as you.

68
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,340
Indeed you are, my lady.
No one has questioned--

69
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,470
And I don't need
your permission to
defend the North.

70
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,220
We'll begin training
every man, woman, boy,
and girl on Bear Island.

71
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,300
Men: Aye!

72
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,800
While we're
preparing for attack,

73
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,130
we need to shore up
our defenses.

74
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:25,630
The only thing standing
between us and the Army
of the Dead is the Wall,

75
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,550
and the Wall hasn't been
properly manned in centuries.

76
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,970
I'm not the king
of the Free Folk.

77
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,840
But if we're going to survive
this winter together...

78
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,050
You want us to man
the castles for you?

79
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,630
Jon: Aye.

80
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,470
Last time we saw
the Night King was
at Hardhome.

81
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,800
The closest castle to Hardhome
is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

82
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,340
Then that's
where I'll go.

83
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,510
Looks like we're
the Night's Watch now.

84
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,380
If they breach
the Wall,

85
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,920
the first two castles
in their path

86
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,470
are Last Hearth
and Karhold.

87
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,130
The Umbers
and the Karstarks
betrayed the North.

88
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,760
Their castles
should be torn down

89
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,510
with not a stone
left standing.

90
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:10,090
The castles
committed no crimes.

91
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,510
And we need
every fortress we have
for the war to come.

92
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,840
We should give the Last Hearth
and Karhold to new families,

93
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,380
loyal families
who supported us
against Ramsay.

94
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,590
Men:
Aye!

95
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,880
The Umbers
and the Karstarks

96
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,380
have fought beside
the Starks for centuries.

97
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,550
- They've kept faith for
generation after generation.
- And then they broke faith.

98
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,630
I'm not going to
strip these families
of their ancestral homes

99
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,220
because of the crimes
of a few reckless sons.

100
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,880
Sansa:
So there's no punishment
for treason

101
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,380
and no reward
for loyalty?

102
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,220
The punishment
for treason is death.

103
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,050
Smalljon Umber died
on the field of battle.

104
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,880
Harald Karstark died
on the field of battle.

105
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,300
They died
fighting for Ramsay.

106
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,880
Give the castles
to the families

107
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,260
of the men who died
fighting for you.

108
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,380
When I was Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch...

109
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,220
I executed men
who betrayed me.

110
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,470
I executed men who
refused to follow orders.

111
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,260
My father always said,

112
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,840
"The man
who passes the sentence
should swing the sword,"

113
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,130
and I have tried
to live by those words.

114
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,590
But I will not punish a son
for his father's sins,

115
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,050
and I will not take
a family home away

116
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,420
from a family it has
belonged to for centuries.

117
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,010
That is my decision,

118
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,590
and my decision is final.

119
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Ned Umber.

120
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,130
Alys Karstark.

121
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,970
For centuries,
our families fought

122
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,800
side by side
on the battlefield.

123
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:28,800
I ask you
to pledge your loyalty
once again to House Stark,

124
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,340
to serve
as our bannermen

125
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,050
and come to our aid
whenever called upon.

126
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,970
Stand.

127
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,470
Yesterday's wars
don't matter anymore.

128
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,470
The North needs
to band together,

129
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,840
all the living north.

130
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,510
Will you stand beside me,
Ned and Alys,

131
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,760
now and always?

132
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,220
Both:
Now and always!

133
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,590
Jon:
You are my sister,
but I am king now.

134
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,220
Will you start
wearing a crown?

135
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,840
When you question
my decisions

136
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,010
in front of
the other lords and ladies,
you undermine me.

137
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:32,720
- So I can't question
your decisions anymore?
- Of course you can, but--

138
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,050
Joffrey never let anyone
question his authority.

139
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,050
You think
he was a good king?

140
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,670
Do you think
I'm Joffrey?

141
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,220
You're as far from Joffrey
as anyone I've ever met.

142
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,720
Thank you.

143
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,420
You're good at this,
you know.

144
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,880
- At what?
- At ruling.

145
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,720
No.

146
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,590
You are.

147
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,220
You are.

148
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:04,010
They respect you,
they really do,

149
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:06,170
but you have to--

150
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,590
Why are you laughing?

151
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,760
What did father
used to say?

152
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,090
Everything before
the word "but"
is horse shit.

153
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,590
He never
said that to me.

154
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,300
No. No, he never cursed
in front of his girls.

155
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,380
Sansa:
Because he was trying
to protect us.

156
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,380
He never wanted us to see
how dirty the world really is,

157
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,090
but Father
couldn't protect me
and neither can you.

158
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,800
- Stop trying.
- All right, I'll stop
trying to protect you

159
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,170
and you stop trying
to undermine me.

160
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,380
I'm not trying
to undermine you!

161
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,970
You have to be
smarter than Father.

162
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,630
You need to be
smarter than Robb.

163
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,760
I loved them, I miss them,
but they made stupid mistakes,

164
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,800
and they both
lost their heads for it.

165
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,010
And how should
I be smarter?

166
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,470
By listening to you?

167
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,800
Would that be
so terrible?

168
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,760
A raven from
King's Landing,
Your Grace.

169
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,800
"Cersei of House Lannister,
First of Her Name,

170
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,720
Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

171
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,340
Protector of
the Seven Kingdoms--"

172
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,800
What does she want?

173
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,840
Come to King's Landing.

174
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,670
Bend the knee or suffer
the fate of all traitors.

175
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,800
You've been so consumed
with the enemy to the north,

176
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,630
you've forgotten about
the one to the south.

177
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,670
I'm consumed
with the Night King
because I've seen him.

178
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,300
And believe me, you'd think
of little else if you had, too.

179
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,010
We still have
a wall between us
and the Night King.

180
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,840
There's nothing
between us and Cersei.

181
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,760
There's a thousand miles
between us and Cersei.

182
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,550
Winter is here.
The Lannisters are
a southern army.

183
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,010
They've never ranged
this far north.

184
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,340
You're the military man,
but I know her.

185
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,670
If you're her enemy,
she'll never stop until
she's destroyed you.

186
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,840
Everyone who's
ever crossed her,
she's found a way to murder.

187
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,010
You almost sound
as if you admire her.

188
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,840
I learned
a great deal from her.

189
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,550
What is this?

190
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:44,220
It's what we've been
waiting for our whole lives.

191
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,010
It's what Father trained us for,
whether he knew it or not.

192
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,510
He knew it.

193
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,470
Made me memorize
every damn city, town,

194
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,050
lake, forest,
and mountain.

195
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,220
It's ours now.
We just have to take it.

196
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,090
You've been quiet
since you came home.

197
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,550
Are you angry
with me?

198
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,800
No, not angry.

199
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,880
Are you afraid of me?

200
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,050
Should I be?

201
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,760
Daenerys Targaryen
has chosen Tyrion
to be her Hand.

202
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,550
Right now, they're sailing
across the Narrow Sea,

203
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,550
hoping to take back
her father's throne.

204
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,970
Our little brother,

205
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,130
the one you love
so much,

206
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,970
the one you set free,

207
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,260
the one who
murdered our father
and our first-born son,

208
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,590
now he stands
beside our enemies
and gives them counsel.

209
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,300
He's out there somewhere
at the head of an armada.

210
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,010
Where will they land?

211
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,130
Dragonstone.

212
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,920
They have
deep-water ports
for the ships.

213
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Stannis left
the castle unoccupied,

214
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,380
and that's where
she was born.

215
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,670
Enemies to the east.

216
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,470
Enemies to the south--

217
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,470
Ellaria Sand
and her brood of bitches.

218
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,300
Enemies to the west--

219
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,130
Olenna, the old cunt.

220
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,340
Another traitor.

221
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,510
Enemies to the north.

222
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,630
Ned Stark's bastard has been
named King in the North

223
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,630
and that murdering whore
Sansa stands beside him.

224
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,300
Enemies everywhere.
We're surrounded by traitors.

225
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,010
You're in command
of the Lannister army now.

226
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,130
- How do we proceed?
- Winter is here.

227
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,420
We can't win a war
if we can't feed our men
and our horses.

228
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,590
The Tyrells have the grain,
the Tyrells have the livestock.

229
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:32,630
Will the Tyrell bannermen
stand alongside

230
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,920
a Dothraki horde
and Unsullied slave soldiers?

231
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,590
If they think
Daenerys will win.

232
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,550
No one wants to fight
on the losing side.

233
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,670
Right now,
we look like
the losing side.

234
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

235
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,550
Three kingdoms, at best.

236
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,090
I'm not sure you understand
how much danger we're in.

237
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,880
I understand we're
in a war for survival.

238
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,920
I understand
whoever loses dies.

239
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,220
I understand whoever wins
could launch a dynasty

240
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,800
that lasts
a thousand years.

241
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,380
A dynasty for whom?

242
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,380
Our children are dead.

243
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,840
We're the last of us.

244
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,880
A dynasty
for us, then.

245
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,590
We never talked
about Tommen.

246
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,550
There's nothing to say.

247
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,510
Our baby boy
killed himself.

248
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,050
He betrayed me.

249
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,550
He betrayed us both.

250
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,380
Should we spend our days
mourning the dead--

251
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,800
mother, father,
and all our children?

252
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,380
- Cersei--
- I loved them. I did.

253
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,590
But they're ashes now
and we're still flesh
and blood.

254
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,590
We're the last Lannisters,
the last ones who count.

255
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,090
Even Lannisters can't
survive without allies.

256
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,260
Where are
our allies now?

257
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,470
You saw what happened
to Walder Frey and
his family.

258
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,130
I heard.

259
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,670
- How could we ever trust
a man like that?
- We couldn't.

260
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,670
He was a useless,
old coward,

261
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,510
but the Freys
supported us.

262
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,880
Now they're all dead.

263
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,590
Whoever killed them
is no friend of ours.

264
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,130
We need allies.

265
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,920
Stronger,
better allies.

266
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,050
We can't win
this war alone.

267
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,670
You think I listened
to Father for 40 years
and learned nothing?

268
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,170
Jaime:
The Greyjoys?

269
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,760
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing?

270
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,590
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like
all of them.

271
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,170
I invited
Euron Greyjoy,

272
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,670
the new King
of the Iron Islands.

273
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,380
You said yourself
we needed stronger,
better allies.

274
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,510
- There you are.
- How are they better allies?

275
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,920
How are they different
from the Freys?

276
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,510
They both broke
their promises

277
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,800
and murdered
their former friends
as soon as it suited them.

278
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,800
So does everyone
when it suits them.

279
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,420
Unlike the Freys,
they have ships.

280
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,050
- And they're good at killing.
- They're not good at anything.

281
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,470
I know the ironborn.
They're bitter, angry
little people.

282
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:27,670
All they know how to do
is steal things they can't
build or grow themselves.

283
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,800
Euron Greyjoy didn't
come here for that.

284
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,840
Oh, what did
he come here for, then?

285
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,510
A queen.

286
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,420
Euron:
The moment I was chosen
Lord of the Iron Islands,

287
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,800
they turned on me.

288
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,050
Their own uncle.

289
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,670
They stole
my best ships and ran.

290
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,840
Sailed them
right across the world

291
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,130
and gave them
to the Dragon Queen

292
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,590
so she could bring
her armies here
to attack you.

293
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,050
It's nothing compared
to the treason you suffered

294
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:10,720
at the hands
of a family member,
from what I hear.

295
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,420
But still,
it bothers me.

296
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,090
Murdering them would
make me feel a lot better.

297
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,260
And since it appears
that all our treasonous
family members

298
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,170
are fighting
for the same side,

299
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,720
I thought
we rightful monarchs

300
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,300
could murder them
together.

301
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,090
You're not
a rightful monarch,
though, are you?

302
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,220
The Greyjoys
rebelled against the throne
for the right to be monarchs,

303
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,260
but as I recall,
you were soundly defeated.

304
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,090
Come to mention it,

305
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,470
weren't you the one
who started that rebellion

306
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,670
by sailing to Casterly Rock
and burning the Lannister fleet?

307
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,380
You certainly
caught us there.

308
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,220
Very smart move
on your part.

309
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,470
Of course,
we all made it to
the Iron Islands anyway.

310
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,670
I was there.

311
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,510
I remember very well.

312
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,050
I saw you.

313
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,340
I heard so much talk.

314
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,970
The best in the world.
No one can stop him.

315
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,670
I didn't believe it,
to be honest.

316
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,970
But I must say
when you rushed
through the breach

317
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,130
and started
cutting people down...

318
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,340
it was glorious.

319
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,760
Like a dance.

320
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,970
The people
I was cutting down
were your own kin.

321
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,300
The place
was getting crowded.

322
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,880
I enjoyed watching it.
I truly did.

323
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,090
And I enjoyed
killing Greyjoys.

324
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,550
A good thing for me.

325
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:47,170
If you hadn't crushed us,
I wouldn't have gone
into exile.

326
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,090
If I hadn't done that,

327
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,670
I wouldn't be
the greatest captain
on the 14 seas.

328
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,550
If not the most humble.

329
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
You're not humble.

330
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
You're the queen
of a great nation.

331
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:04,760
You don't care about
the Iron Islands.

332
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,420
They're nothing but rocks
and bird shit and--

333
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,300
and a lot of very
unattractive people.

334
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,920
The Iron Fleet,
on the other hand,

335
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,050
that's something else
entirely.

336
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,340
It's the greatest armada
Westeros has ever seen.

337
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,920
With the Iron Fleet,
you own the seas.

338
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,760
You can defeat
the invaders of the east

339
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,720
and the pretenders
of the north and south.

340
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,340
What do you want
in return?

341
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,470
Ever since
I was a little boy,

342
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,380
I wanted to grow up
and marry

343
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,510
the most beautiful woman
in the world.

344
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:45,220
So here I am,

345
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,670
with a thousand ships

346
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,220
and two good hands.

347
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,220
I decline your proposal.

348
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,760
Why?

349
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,420
You're not trustworthy.

350
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,920
You've broken promises
to allies before

351
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,380
and murdered them
at the nearest opportunity.

352
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,920
You murdered
your own brother.

353
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,590
You should try it.
Feels wonderful.

354
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,260
I don't expect you
to trust me outright.

355
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,630
You need proof
of my honest intentions.

356
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:20,090
In my experience,

357
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,090
the surest way
to a woman's heart
is with a gift.

358
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,380
A priceless gift.

359
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,260
I won't return
to King's Landing

360
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,300
until I have that
for you.

361
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,130
Ah, Maester Weyland.

362
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,630
A drinker's liver
if ever I saw one.

363
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,840
Weigh that.

364
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,340
The triumph
of transitory pleasures.

365
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,260
Mankind's curse.

366
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,340
Archmaester,
I was wondering...

367
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,300
What's the weight?

368
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,260
Um, 147.

369
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,260
I was wondering if you had
considered my proposition.

370
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,340
I don't remember
your proposition.

371
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,630
I asked you if,
in light of what
I've seen in the North,

372
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,800
if I could have access
to the restricted area
of the library.

373
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,510
That area is reserved
for maesters.

374
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,010
- Are you a maester?
- No.

375
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,130
Not a very strong
proposition, is it?

376
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,090
Archmaester,
with respect,

377
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,920
I've seen them--

378
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,170
the Army of the Dead.

379
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,550
The white walkers.

380
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,050
I was sent here to learn
how to defeat them,

381
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,590
but everyone
in the Citadel,

382
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,760
those who will even
talk to me,

383
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,590
they all doubt
the walkers ever existed
in the first place.

384
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:51,130
Everyone in the Citadel
doubts everything.

385
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,220
It's their job.

386
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,050
But the tales
of the Long Night
can't be pure fabrication.

387
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,800
Too many similarities
from unconnected sources.

388
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,380
Sources in
the restricted area?

389
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,010
The very same.

390
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,760
And the simplest
explanation

391
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,720
for your grating obsession
with the white walkers

392
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,220
is that you're
telling the truth

393
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,340
and that you saw
what you say you saw.

394
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,220
So, you believe me.

395
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,050
I do.

396
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,760
You'll finish
weighing that heart?

397
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,880
That makes you
the only person
south of the Twins who does.

398
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,760
We're not like the people
south of the Twins.

399
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,970
And we're not
like the people
north of the Twins.

400
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,220
In the Citadel,
we lead different lives
for different reasons.

401
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,880
We are this world's memory,
Samwell Tarly.

402
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,840
Without us, men would be
little better than dogs.

403
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,010
Don't remember
any meal but the last,

404
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:59,670
can't see forward
to any but the next.

405
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,840
And every time
you leave the house
and shut the door,

406
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,760
they howl like
you're gone forever.

407
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,760
When Robert's Rebellion
was raging,

408
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,590
people thought
the end was near.

409
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:12,670
The end of
the Targaryen dynasty.
"How will we survive?"

410
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,130
When Aegon Targaryen
turned his eye westward

411
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,090
and flew his dragons
to Blackwater Rush--

412
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,130
"The end is near!
How will we survive?"

413
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,010
And thousands
of years before that,
during the Long Night,

414
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,130
we can forgive them
for thinking it truly
was the end.

415
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,840
But it wasn't.
None of it was.

416
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,170
The Wall has stood
through it all.

417
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:36,420
And every winter
that ever came has ended.

418
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,800
Be a good lad.
Clean this up.

419
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,300
Nope.

420
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,420
Nope.

421
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,880
You're a lucky man.

422
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,220
Littlefinger:
I've heard she beat
the Hound in single combat.

423
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,510
She's a very
impressive woman.

424
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,050
What do you want,
Lord Baelish?

425
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,420
I want you
to be happy.

426
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,800
I want you
to be safe.

427
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,090
I am safe.

428
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:34,260
I'm at home,
surrounded by friends.

429
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,630
I have Brienne to protect me
from anyone who would harm me.

430
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,300
What about happy?

431
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:47,800
Why aren't you happy?

432
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,760
What do you want
that you do not have?

433
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,510
At the moment,
peace and quiet.

434
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:00,800
No need to seize
the last word,
Lord Baelish.

435
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,170
I'll assume it was
something clever.

436
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,010
Littlefinger:
My lady.

437
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,800
My lady.

438
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,840
Why is he still here?

439
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,590
We need his men.

440
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,170
Without the Vale,
Ramsay Bolton would
still hold this castle.

441
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,170
Littlefinger saved us.

442
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,970
Brienne:
He wants something.

443
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,090
I know exactly
what he wants.

444
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,840
Man:
♪ He rode through
the streets of the city ♪

445
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,880
♪ Down from
his hill on high ♪

446
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,470
♪ O'er the winds and the steps
and the cobbles ♪

447
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,970
♪ He rode
to a woman's sigh ♪

448
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,170
♪ For she was
his secret treasure ♪

449
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,590
♪ She was his shame
and his bliss ♪

450
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,510
♪ And a chain and a keep
are nothing ♪

451
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,170
♪ Compared to
a woman's kiss ♪

452
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,670
Men:
♪ For hands of gold
are always cold ♪

453
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,340
♪ But a woman's hands
are warm ♪

454
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:21,170
♪ For hands of gold
are always cold ♪

455
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,170
♪ But a woman's hands are-- ♪

456
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,920
That's a pretty song.

457
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,010
I've never
heard it before.

458
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:29,470
It's a new one.

459
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,470
Man #2:
Are you hungry?
We've got some rabbit.

460
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,920
I don't want
to steal your food.

461
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,300
You're not stealing,
we're offering.

462
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,670
Come on,
it's gonna be
a cold night.

463
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,670
You heading south?

464
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,760
King's Landing.

465
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,840
Poor girl.

466
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,510
Not so bad, is it?

467
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,630
Depends on your taste,
I guess.

468
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,920
If you like your streets covered
in shit and pig's blood,
it's the town for you.

469
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,760
Man #2: All my life,
I wanted to see the Red Keep,

470
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,920
the Sept of Baelor,
the Dragonpit.

471
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,880
Then when
I finally make it,

472
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,090
they wouldn't
let me within a mile
of the Red Keep,

473
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,050
the Sept of Baelor's
blown to hell,

474
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,010
and the Dragonpit
is a damn ruin.

475
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,880
The people who live there,

476
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,590
they'd skin you alive
if they could make two
coppers off your hide.

477
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,720
Worst place
in the world.

478
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,090
What are you doing
in the Riverlands?

479
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:45,670
There's been
some trouble with the Freys
up at the Twins,

480
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,010
so we're part of the army
that's been sent to
keep the peace.

481
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,920
Here you go.
Guests first.

482
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,050
Oh, no, I couldn't.
You don't have enough.

483
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,510
My mother always told me
to be kind to strangers.

484
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,470
Strangers
will be kind to you.

485
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,050
You're a long way
from home.

486
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,130
I'm sure you've had
some adventures, though.

487
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,970
Yeah,
endless adventures.

488
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,630
- They'll be singing about us
for a thousand years.

489
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,300
The truth is
when we left home,
we couldn't wait to get away.

490
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,630
But now we've
been gone a while,
we can't wait to get home.

491
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:33,670
I just think
about my dad out there
on his boat all alone.

492
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,050
I ought to be
out there with him.

493
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:39,010
My wife just had
our first baby.

494
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,300
- Boy or girl?
- Oh, who knows?

495
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,470
You think soldiers
get ravens with
news from home?

496
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,920
- I hope it's a girl.
- Why?

497
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,880
Girls take care of their papas
when their papas grow old.

498
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
Boys just go off to fight
in someone else's wars.

499
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,470
Man #2:
Are you old enough
to drink?

500
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,800
It's blackberry wine.

501
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,090
I made it myself.

502
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,670
It's really good.

503
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,170
So, why is
a nice girl on her own
heading to King's Landing?

504
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,720
I'm going to kill
the queen.

505
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,090
Thoros:
Bad night
to be outdoors.

506
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,920
The Hound: You've got
real powerful magic
to figure that out.

507
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,010
Did the Lord of Light
whisper that in your ear?

508
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,170
"It's snowing, Thoros.
It's windy.

509
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,130
It's gonna be
a cold night."

510
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:16,010
You're a grouchy old bear,
aren't you, Clegane?

511
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,670
You want some rum?

512
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,760
Don't like that shit.
It's too sweet.

513
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,800
Why are you always
in such a foul mood?

514
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,090
Experience.

515
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,550
This seems
like a good place
to spend the night.

516
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,630
These people
don't want us here.

517
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,550
Beric:
Seems deserted to me.
No livestock.

518
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,510
No smoke coming
from the chimney.

519
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,470
I don't like
the look of it.

520
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:07,470
For a big, hard man,
you scare easy.

521
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:10,090
I'll tell you
what doesn't scare me--

522
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,090
bald cocksuckers
like you.

523
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:14,970
You think
you're fooling anyone
with that top knot?

524
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,760
Bald cunt.

525
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,380
Come on.

526
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,220
Maybe they've got
some ale hidden away.

527
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,340
They don't.

528
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,920
See if there's a larder.

529
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,630
They always leave
something behind.

530
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,590
How do you think
it ended for them?

531
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,420
With death.

532
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,380
Girl died
in her father's arms.

533
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,220
Both of them covered in blood
and a knife at their feet.

534
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,340
I'd say
they were starving.

535
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,260
And rather than
let his little girl suffer,

536
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,220
he ended it
for both of them.

537
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,470
Doesn't matter now.

538
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,260
No, doesn't matter now.

539
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,420
I've known you
a long time, Dondarrion.

540
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,920
Aye.

541
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,010
I think the first time we met
was at that tournament--

542
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,260
And I always thought
you were dull as dirt.

543
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,340
You're not bad.

544
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,720
I don't hate you.

545
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,090
Don't like you,
but you're not bad.

546
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,920
Thank you, Clegane.

547
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,260
That warms the heart.

548
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,920
But there's nothing
special about you.

549
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,760
You're right about that.

550
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,220
So why does
the Lord of Light
keep bringing you back?

551
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,590
I've met better men
than you,

552
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:27,510
and they've been hanged
from crossbeams,
or beheaded,

553
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:32,380
or just
shat themselves to death
in a field somewhere.

554
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,470
None of them came back.

555
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,050
So, why you?

556
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,970
You think I don't
ask myself that?

557
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,130
Every hour
of every day?

558
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:44,800
Why am I here?

559
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:47,970
What am I
supposed to do?

560
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,760
What does the Lord
see in me?

561
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,090
And?

562
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,470
I don't know.

563
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,470
I don't understand
our Lord.

564
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,300
Your  Lord.

565
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,090
I don't know
what He wants from me.

566
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:07,590
I only know that
He wants me alive.

567
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:11,880
If he's so all-powerful,
why doesn't he just tell you
what the fuck he wants?

568
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:15,760
Thoros:
Clegane.

569
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,130
Come over here.

570
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,510
Don't worry.
The fire won't bite.

571
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:25,800
I want to show you
something.

572
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,010
It's my fucking luck
I end up with a band
of fire worshippers.

573
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,510
Aye.

574
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,840
Almost seems like
divine justice.

575
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,380
There's no divine justice,
you dumb cunt.

576
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,510
If there was,
you'd be dead...

577
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,670
and that girl
would be alive.

578
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:50,880
- What do you want?
- Look into the flames.

579
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,010
I don't want to look
in the damn flames.

580
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:56,550
You saw me
bring him back from the dead
after you cut him down.

581
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,420
Don't you want to know
what gave me the power?

582
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,880
I keep asking
and no one wants
to tell me.

583
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,380
We can't tell you.

584
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:07,550
Only the fire
can tell you.

585
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,590
What do you see?

586
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,800
Logs burning.

587
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,880
Keep looking.

588
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:33,760
What do you see?

589
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,970
Ice.

590
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:47,880
A wall of ice.

591
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,300
The  Wall.

592
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,340
What else?

593
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:59,550
It's where the Wall
meets the sea.

594
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,970
There's a castle there.

595
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,880
There's a mountain.

596
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,340
Looks like an arrowhead.

597
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,130
The dead are
marching past.

598
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:26,920
Thousands of them.

599
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:34,470
Do you believe me
now, Clegane?

600
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:38,090
Do you believe
we're here for a reason?

601
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,340
What the hell
are you doing, Clegane?

602
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,340
Burying the dead.

603
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,550
You knew these people.

604
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,050
Not really.

605
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,380
We ask the Father
to judge us with mercy.

606
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,420
We ask the Mother to...

607
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,420
Fuck it, I don't
remember the rest.

608
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,920
I'm sorry you're dead.

609
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,840
You deserved better.

610
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,840
Both of you.

611
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,470
Gilly:
Hey.

612
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,050
Mom.

613
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,800
You should
really sleep, Sam.

614
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,800
The dead don't.

615
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:48,170
"Legends of the Long Night."

616
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,170
The Targaryens
used dragonglass
to decorate their weapons

617
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,720
without even knowing
what the First Men
used it for.

618
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,010
What is it?

619
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,760
It's a map
of Dragonstone.

620
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,050
The Targaryens built
their first stronghold there

621
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,840
when they invaded
Westeros.

622
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,300
That's dragonglass?

623
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,050
A mountain of it.

624
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,220
Beneath the ground.

625
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,550
Stannis told me,
but I didn't think...

626
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:35,050
This is important.
Jon needs to know.

627
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:30,420
Jorah:
Has she come yet?

628
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,050
Who?

629
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:34,260
The Dragon Queen.

630
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,220
Daenerys Stormborn.

631
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,130
Haven't heard anything.

632
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,130
Shall we begin?

633
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,220
A Targaryen cannot be trusted.

634
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:47,970
The Mad King's daughter
will destroy the realm.

635
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:50,720
We have an army
of fleets and three dragons.

636
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,220
We should hit
King's Landing now.
﻿1
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,030
Tyrion:
On a night like this,
you came into the world.

2
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,320
Varys:
I remember that storm.

3
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,070
All the dogs
in King's Landing

4
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,070
howled through
the night.

5
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,700
I wish I could
remember it.

6
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,620
I always thought
this would be a homecoming.

7
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,410
Doesn't feel
like home.

8
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,740
We won't stay
on Dragonstone for long.

9
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,030
Good.

10
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,280
Daenerys:
Not so many lions.

11
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,200
Varys:
Cersei controls fewer
than half the Seven Kingdoms.

12
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,490
The lords of Westeros
despise her.

13
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,370
Even before your arrival,
they plotted against her.

14
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,870
- Now...
- They cry out
for their true queen?

15
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,490
They drink secret toasts
to my health?

16
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,450
People used to
tell my brother
that sort of thing,

17
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,490
and he was stupid enough
to believe them.

18
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,320
If Viserys had three dragons
and an army at his back,

19
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,320
he'd have invaded
King's Landing already.

20
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,910
Conquering Westeros
would be easy for you.

21
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,320
But you're not here
to be queen of the ashes.

22
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,070
No.

23
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,320
We can take
the Seven Kingdoms

24
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,200
without turning it
into a slaughterhouse.

25
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,780
If the great houses support
your claim against Cersei,

26
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,870
the game is won.

27
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:38,320
With the Tyrell army
and the Dornish
on our side,

28
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,490
we have powerful allies
in the south.

29
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,070
I never properly
thanked you for that.

30
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,830
They joined our side,
my queen,

31
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,370
because
they believe in you.

32
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,700
You served my father,
didn't you, Lord Varys?

33
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,320
I did.

34
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,660
And then you served
the man who overthrew him.

35
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,410
I had a choice,
Your Grace--

36
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,530
serve Robert Baratheon
or face the headman's axe.

37
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,870
But you didn't
serve him long.

38
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,320
You turned
against him.

39
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,490
Robert was an improvement
on your father, to be sure.

40
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,580
There have been
few rulers in history

41
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,660
as cruel
as the Mad King.

42
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,120
Robert was
neither mad nor cruel.

43
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,660
He simply had no interest
in being king.

44
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,370
So you took it upon yourself
to find a better one.

45
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,580
Your Grace,

46
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,580
when I was
ready to drink myself
into a small coffin,

47
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,620
Lord Varys told me about
a queen in the east who--

48
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,530
Before I came to power,
you favored my brother.

49
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,240
All your spies,
your little birds,

50
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,910
did they tell you Viserys
was cruel, stupid, and weak?

51
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,530
Would those qualities
have made for a good king
in your learned opinion?

52
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,200
Until your marriage
to Khal Drogo, Your Grace,

53
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,700
I knew nothing about you,
save your existence

54
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,030
and that you were said
to be beautiful.

55
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,740
So you and your friends
traded me like a prized horse
to the Dothraki.

56
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,740
Which you turned
to your advantage.

57
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,780
Who gave the order
to kill me?

58
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,830
King Robert.

59
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,580
Who hired
the assassins?

60
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,740
Who sent word to Essos
to murder Daenerys Targaryen?

61
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,280
- Your Grace, I did
what had to be done to--
- To keep yourself alive.

62
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,580
Lord Varys
has proven himself
a loyal servant.

63
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,370
Proven himself loyal?
Quite the opposite.

64
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,070
If he dislikes one monarch,
he conspires to crown
the next one.

65
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,490
What kind of a servant
is that?

66
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,620
The kind
the realm needs.

67
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,990
Incompetence should not
be rewarded with
blind loyalty.

68
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,950
As long
as I have my eyes,
I'll use them.

69
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
I wasn't born
into a great house.

70
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,240
I came from nothing.

71
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,200
I was sold as a slave
and carved up as an offering.

72
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,030
When I was a child,
I lived in alleys, gutters,
abandoned houses.

73
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,620
You wish to know
where my true loyalties lie?

74
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,830
Not with any king or queen,
but with the people.

75
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,780
The people
who suffer under despots
and prosper under just rule.

76
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,160
The people whose hearts
you aim to win.

77
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,870
If you demand
blind allegiance,

78
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,620
I respect your wishes.

79
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,620
Grey Worm can behead me
or your dragons
can devour me.

80
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,200
But if you let me live,
I will serve you well.

81
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,490
I will dedicate myself
to seeing you on
the Iron Throne

82
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,990
because I choose you.

83
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,530
Because I know the people
have no better chance
than you.

84
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,990
Swear this to me,
Varys.

85
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,950
If you ever think
I'm failing the people,

86
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:44,160
you won't conspire
behind my back.

87
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,120
You'll look me in the eye
as you have done today,

88
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,950
and you'll tell me
how I'm failing them.

89
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,950
I swear it,
my queen.

90
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,200
And I swear this--
if you ever betray me,

91
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,910
I'll burn you alive.

92
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,660
I would expect nothing less
from the Mother of Dragons.

93
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,700
Forgive me, my queen.

94
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,870
A red priestess from As'shai
has come to see you.

95
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,950
She once served another
who wanted the Iron Throne.

96
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:03,870
It didn't end well
for Stannis Baratheon,
did it?

97
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,530
No, it didn't.

98
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,370
You chose an auspicious day
to arrive at Dragonstone.

99
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,240
We've just decided
to pardon those

100
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,910
who once served
the wrong king.

101
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,240
The Lord of Light
doesn't have many followers
in Westeros, does he?

102
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,910
Not yet, but even those
who don't worship the Lord

103
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,410
can serve his cause.

104
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,320
What does your lord
expect from me?

105
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,660
"The prince who was promised
will bring the dawn."

106
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,950
I'm afraid
I'm not a prince.

107
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,530
Missandei:
Your Grace,
forgive me,

108
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:44,490
but your translation
is not quite accurate.

109
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,240
That noun has no gender
in High Valyrian,

110
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,200
so the proper translation
for that prophecy would be,

111
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,580
"The prince or princess
who was promised will
bring the dawn."

112
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,740
Doesn't really roll
off the tongue, does it?

113
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,280
No, but I like it
better.

114
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,830
And you believe
this prophecy
refers to me?

115
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,620
Prophecies are
dangerous things.

116
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,950
I believe you have
a role to play.

117
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,830
As does another--

118
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,320
the King in the North,
Jon Snow.

119
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,030
Jon Snow?

120
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,830
- Ned Stark's bastard?
- You know him?

121
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:20,990
I travelled with him
to the Wall when he joined
the Night's Watch.

122
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,120
And why do you
think the Lord of Light
singled out this Jon Snow?

123
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,830
Aside from the visions
you've seen in the flames,
that is.

124
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,740
As Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch,

125
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,990
he allowed the wildlings
south of the Wall

126
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,070
to protect them
from grave danger.

127
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,660
As King in the North,

128
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,490
he has united those wildlings
with the Northern houses,

129
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,990
so together they may
face their common enemy.

130
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,120
He sounds like
quite a man.

131
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,490
Summon Jon Snow.

132
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,160
Let him stand
before you

133
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,780
and tell you the things
that have happened to him,

134
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,410
the things
that he has seen
with his own eyes.

135
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,580
I can't speak
to prophecies

136
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,200
or visions
in the flames,

137
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,990
but I like Jon Snow
and I trusted him.

138
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,490
And I am an excellent
judge of character.

139
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:06,950
If he does
rule the North,

140
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,700
he would make
a valuable ally.

141
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,950
The Lannisters
executed his father

142
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,120
and conspired
to murder his brother.

143
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,320
Jon Snow has even more reason
to hate Cersei than you do.

144
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,490
Very well.

145
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,280
Send a raven north.

146
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Tell Jon Snow
that his queen

147
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,280
invites him to come
to Dragonstone...

148
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,030
and bend the knee.

149
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Gather round.
Come here.

150
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,070
Sansa:
You think
it's really Tyrion?

151
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,580
It could be someone
trying to lure you
into a trap.

152
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,120
Read the last bit.

153
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,740
"All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes."

154
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,490
What does that mean?

155
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,410
It's something he said to me
the first night we met.

156
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,580
You know him better
than any of us.

157
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
What do you think?

158
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,830
Tyrion's not like
the other Lannisters.

159
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,620
He was always kind to me,
but it's too great a risk.

160
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,620
"The Seven Kingdoms
will bleed

161
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,120
as long as Cersei sits
on the Iron Throne.

162
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,280
Join us.

163
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,120
Together, we can
end her tyranny."

164
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Sounds like a charmer.

165
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,490
Of course,
the casual mention
of a Dothraki horde,

166
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,450
a legion of Unsullied,
and three dragons--

167
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,990
a bit less charming.

168
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,160
What?

169
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,410
Fire kills wights,
you told me.

170
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,580
What breathes fire?

171
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,780
You're not suggesting
Jon meet with her?

172
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,200
- No, too dangerous.
- But?

173
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,160
But if the Army of the Dead
makes it past the Wall,

174
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,660
do we have enough men
to fight them?

175
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,370
If the Mad King's daughter
takes the Iron Throne,

176
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,280
she'll destroy the realm
as we know it.

177
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,530
Some of you are bannermen
of House Tyrell.

178
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:12,660
But House Tyrell
is in open rebellion
against the crown.

179
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,870
With their help,
the Mad King's daughter

180
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,370
has ferried
an army of savages
to our shores--

181
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,160
mindless Unsullied soldiers
who will destroy your castles
and your holdfasts,

182
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,320
Dothraki heathens
who will burn your
villages to the ground,

183
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,530
rape and enslave
your women,

184
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,450
and butcher your children
without a second thought.

185
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,320
This is how Olenna Tyrell
rewards centuries of service
and loyalty.

186
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,160
Cersei: You all remember
the Mad King.

187
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,700
You remember the horrors
he inflicted upon his people.

188
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
His daughter
is no different.

189
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,490
In Essos, her brutality
is already legendary.

190
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,780
She crucified
hundreds of noblemen
in Slaver's Bay.

191
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,450
And when she
grew bored of that,

192
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,700
she fed them
to her dragons.

193
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,280
It is my solemn duty
to protect the people,
and I will.

194
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,450
But I need your help,
my lords.

195
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,240
We must stand together,
all of us...

196
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,450
if we hope to stop her.

197
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,870
She has three
full-grown dragons,
Your Grace.

198
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,030
The same as Aegon
when he conquered

199
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,530
the Seven Kingdoms.

200
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,910
How do you propose
to stop them?

201
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,700
We are currently at work
on a solution, my lord.

202
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,580
Lord Tarly.

203
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,320
Ser Jaime.

204
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,030
I believe
you know my son.

205
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,030
Ser Jaime.

206
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,530
Rickard, isn't it?

207
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,240
Dickon.

208
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,780
That's it.

209
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,780
Thank you for coming.

210
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,700
The other lords of the Reach
look to you for guidance,
now more than ever.

211
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,410
They might not have come
if you hadn't.

212
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,700
If my queen summons me,
I answer the call.

213
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,490
And I've heard
what she does to
those who defy her.

214
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,740
You ride for
Horn Hill today?

215
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,450
I have an army
to mobilize.

216
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,780
Won't be long before
the fighting starts.

217
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,240
And which side
will you be fighting for?

218
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,580
You were the only man to defeat
Robert Baratheon in battle.

219
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,490
Not even Rhaegar Targaryen
could do that.

220
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,450
It's a long ride back
to the Reach, Ser Jaime.
How may I serve?

221
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,410
I want you to be
my ranking general
in the wars to come.

222
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,530
I want you to swear
allegiance to Cersei

223
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,530
and I want you to help me
destroy her enemies.

224
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,370
All her enemies.

225
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,410
Including
Olenna Tyrell.

226
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,660
I'm a Tarly.

227
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,160
That name
means something.

228
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,200
We're not oathbreakers.
We're not schemers.

229
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,660
We don't stab
our rivals in the back

230
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,490
or cut their throats
at weddings.

231
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,530
I swore an oath
to House Tyrell.

232
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,870
You swore an oath
to the crown as well,
Lord Tarly.

233
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,660
I've known Olenna
since I was a child.

234
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,280
She was
a great woman once.

235
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,660
Now she's broken.

236
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,780
She wants revenge
so badly,

237
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,030
she brought the Dothraki
to our shores.

238
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,950
The Dothraki in Westeros
for the first time
in history.

239
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,870
I know you don't
like my sister,

240
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,030
but you have
to make a choice.

241
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,070
Do you fight with us

242
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,200
or with foreign savages
and eunuchs?

243
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,700
When the war is won,

244
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,870
the queen will need
a new Warden of the South.

245
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,700
I can think
of no better man

246
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,530
than Randyll Tarly.

247
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,370
Ebrose:
The infection
has spread too far.

248
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,320
You should have
cut off your arm
the moment you were touched.

249
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,160
How long?

250
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,030
It'll be years
before it kills you.

251
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,620
Could be 10.

252
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,280
Could be 20.

253
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,030
But how long until...?

254
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,530
Your mind?

255
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,410
Six months,
maybe fewer.

256
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,200
Um...

257
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,910
Pardon, Archmaester.

258
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,910
I met Stannis Baratheon's
daughter at Castle Black.

259
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,370
She had the greyscale
as a baby and was cured.

260
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,950
- Ebrose: No.
- Isn't there some way--

261
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,740
Ebrose:
Does this look like
a baby to you?

262
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,070
- No.
- Have you studied

263
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,120
the varying rates
of greyscale progression

264
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,740
in infants
and fully grown men?

265
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,160
No.

266
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,530
Ebrose:
Maester Cressen discovered

267
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,120
Shireen Baratheon's
affliction immediately.

268
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,280
This is quite advanced.

269
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,320
And beyond
our skills, ser.

270
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,740
Were you a commoner,
I'd have you shipped
to Valyria at once

271
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,280
to live out your life
with the stone men.

272
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:20,120
As an anointed knight,
I'll allow you one more day.

273
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:25,450
How you choose
to spend that time
is up to you.

274
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:32,950
Come, Samwell.

275
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,700
Should we send word
to your family, Ser...?

276
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
Jorah.

277
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,660
Jorah Mormont.

278
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,700
Mormont?

279
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,450
There's no need.

280
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,030
I've been dead
to them for years.

281
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,370
Ebrose:
Come, Samwell!

282
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,240
Qyburn:
Have you ever been
down here, Your Grace?

283
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,740
No, I can't say
I have.

284
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,450
I haven't seen these
since Robert had them
removed from the throne room.

285
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,410
Curious that King Robert
did not have them destroyed.

286
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,580
They were his trophies.

287
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,780
He couldn't
keep them around.

288
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,700
They would have
made him look small.

289
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,240
Sometimes
he would come down here
and look at them.

290
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,410
I believe he brought
his whores on occasion.

291
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,530
Balerion the Dread.

292
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,950
The beast that Aegon
rode across the sea.

293
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,870
His flames forged
the Iron Throne

294
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,740
and brought
the Seven Kingdoms
to heel.

295
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,070
Powerful...

296
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,620
but not invincible.

297
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,410
Apparently,
one of Daenerys's dragons

298
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:13,070
was wounded by spears
in the fighting pits
of Meereen.

299
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,910
And if they can
be wounded,

300
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,280
they can be killed.

301
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,580
The finest artillators
and blacksmiths in
King's Landing

302
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,410
have been laboring
day and night,
Your Grace.

303
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,450
If you'll kindly
pull that lever.

304
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,450
Yara:
If you want
the Iron Throne, take it.

305
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,620
We have an army, a fleet,
and three dragons.

306
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,280
We should hit
King's Landing now, hard,
with everything we have.

307
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,780
The city will fall
within a day.

308
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,700
If we turn the dragons loose,
tens of thousands will die
in the firestorms.

309
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,280
It's called war.

310
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,280
You don't have
the stomach for it,
scurry back into hiding.

311
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,620
I know
how you wage war.

312
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,370
We don't poison
little girls here.

313
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,660
Myrcella was innocent.

314
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,030
She was a Lannister.

315
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,660
There are no
innocent Lannisters.

316
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,950
My greatest regret
is that Oberyn died
fighting for you.

317
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,830
Daenerys:
That's enough.

318
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,410
Lord Tyrion
is Hand of the Queen.

319
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:30,830
You will treat him
with respect.

320
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,830
I am not here to be
queen of the ashes.

321
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,240
That's very nice
to hear.

322
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,200
Of course,
I can't remember a queen

323
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,160
who was better loved
than my granddaughter.

324
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,120
The common people
loved her.

325
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,870
The nobles loved her.

326
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:51,620
And what is left
of her now?

327
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,450
Ashes.

328
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,160
Commoners, nobles,

329
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,030
they're all
just children, really.

330
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,660
They won't obey you
unless they fear you.

331
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,910
I'm grateful
to you, Lady Olenna,
for your counsel.

332
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,830
I'm grateful
to all of you.

333
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,450
But you have chosen
to follow me.

334
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,830
I will not attack
King's Landing.

335
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,660
We  will not attack
King's Landing.

336
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,320
Then how do you mean
to take the Iron Throne?

337
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,660
By asking nicely?

338
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,200
We will lay siege
to the capital,

339
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,910
surrounding the city
on all sides.

340
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,700
Cersei will have
the Iron Throne,

341
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,070
but no food for her army
or the people.

342
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,990
But we won't use
Dothraki and Unsullied.

343
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,030
Cersei will try to rally
the lords of Westeros

344
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,700
by appealing
to their loyalty,

345
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,370
their love
for their country.

346
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,280
If we besiege the city
with foreigners,

347
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,990
we prove her point.

348
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,620
Our army should be
Westerosi.

349
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,910
And I suppose
we're providing
the Westerosi?

350
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,200
You are.

351
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,580
Lady Greyjoy
will escort you home
to Sunspear.

352
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,580
And her Iron Fleet
will ferry the Dornish army

353
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,580
back up to King's Landing.

354
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,410
The Dornish
will lay siege
to the capital

355
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,450
alongside
the Tyrell army.

356
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,120
Two great kingdoms
united against Cersei.

357
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,240
So, your master plan
is to use our armies.

358
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,620
Forgive me for asking,
but why did you bother
to bring your own?

359
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,120
The Unsullied will have
another objective.

360
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,700
For decades,
House Lannister has been
the true power in Westeros.

361
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,870
And the seat of that power
is Casterly Rock.

362
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,780
Grey Worm
and the Unsullied

363
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,660
will sail for the Rock
and take it.

364
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,830
Do I have
your support?

365
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,990
You have mine.

366
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,660
Dorne is with you,
Your Grace.

367
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,320
Thank you all.

368
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,660
Lady Olenna, may I speak
with you alone?

369
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,030
I realize you're here
out of hatred for Cersei
and not love for me.

370
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,950
But I swear to you,
she will pay for
what she's done.

371
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,620
And we will bring peace
back to Westeros.

372
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,660
Peace?

373
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,320
Do you think
that's what we had
under your father?

374
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,450
Or his father?
Or his?

375
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,120
Peace never lasts,
my dear.

376
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,450
Will you take
a bit of advice
from an old woman?

377
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,450
He's a clever man,
your Hand.

378
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,280
I've known
a great many clever men.

379
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,200
I've outlived them all.

380
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,120
You know why?

381
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,660
I ignored them.

382
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,160
The lords of Westeros
are sheep.

383
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,530
Are you a sheep?

384
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,870
No.

385
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,160
You're a dragon.

386
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,700
Be a dragon.

387
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,030
Grey Worm: Mají.

388
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,160
You leave tomorrow.

389
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,410
Were you going
to say goodbye?

390
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,030
I will see you
when I return.

391
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,910
But you don't know
when that will be.

392
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,780
No one knows.

393
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,740
I wish you
good fortune.

394
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,280
Missandei.

395
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,240
It is hard for me
to say goodbye to you.

396
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,450
Why?

397
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,120
You know why.

398
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,200
I don't.

399
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,870
Y-you are my weakness.

400
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,320
That's what I am?

401
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,780
Your weakness?

402
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,490
When Unsullied are young,
the masters learn their fears.

403
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,450
One boy is scared
of dogs,

404
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,320
one boy hates
high places,

405
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:18,160
one is frightened
of the ocean.

406
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,620
They make the boy
sleep with dogs

407
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,530
or climb a cliff.

408
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:24,830
They throw him
in the water.

409
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:27,120
If he learns
to swim, good.

410
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,070
If he drowns, good.

411
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Either way,
strong Unsullied.

412
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,700
But I had no fears.

413
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,490
I was never the biggest,
never the strongest...

414
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:44,160
but I was bravest,
always.

415
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,580
- I believe it.
- Until...

416
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,370
I meet Missandei
from the Isle of Naath.

417
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,160
Now I have fear.

418
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,990
I do, too.

419
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,200
No.

420
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,410
I want to see you.

421
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,120
Please.

422
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,120
Might be useful.

423
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,990
Ch'Vyalthan was
a dreadful writer,

424
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,830
but an excellent
researcher.

425
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,280
- Archmaester,
I wondered if I--
- And this one.

426
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,160
Maester Faull was
quite the opposite--

427
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,910
a brilliant stylist who
invented half the stories
he tells.

428
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,530
Um, I wanted
to ask you--

429
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,320
If you're going
to write histories, Tarly,

430
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,910
you have to do
the research.

431
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,780
If you want people
to read your histories,

432
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,030
you need
a bit of style.

433
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,030
I'm not writing
"A Chronicle of the Wars

434
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,870
Following the Death
of King Robert I"

435
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:26,160
so it can sit
on a shelf unread.

436
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,990
What?
You don't
like the title?

437
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,530
What would you
call it, then?

438
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,870
Mm, possibly something
a bit more poetic?

439
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,620
We're not poets, Tarly.

440
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,780
Um, Archmaester,
if I could just
have a moment.

441
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,530
This is your moment.

442
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,990
Use it wisely.

443
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,990
I may have found a way
to treat Ser Jorah.

444
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,370
There are
two recorded cases

445
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,200
of advanced greyscale
being cured.

446
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,030
I found the procedure
in the study of rare diseases

447
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,370
by Archmaester Pylos.

448
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:59,530
I'm familiar with
Archmaester Pylos

449
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:01,490
and his study
of rare diseases.

450
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,490
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

451
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,410
And shall I tell you
how he died?

452
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,910
From greyscale.

453
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,580
- Oh.
- The procedure's
far too dangerous,

454
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,740
which is why
it's now forbidden.

455
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,580
Hello.

456
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,120
What are you doing?

457
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,660
You're Jorah Mormont,

458
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,620
the only son
of Jeor Mormont.

459
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,740
My name
is Samwell Tarly,

460
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,530
Sworn Brother
of the Night's Watch,

461
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:14,320
training to serve
as maester at Castle Black.

462
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,620
I knew your father.

463
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,120
I was with him
when he died.

464
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,320
You are not
dying today,
Ser Jorah.

465
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,950
Drink this.

466
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,740
- What is it?
- Rum.

467
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,660
Drink it all, please.
I'm afraid this is
going to hurt.

468
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,990
If you could
take off your shirt.

469
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,870
If you wouldn't mind,
bite down hard.

470
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm sorry, but no one
knows I'm here,

471
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,370
and if they
hear you screaming,
then we're both finished.

472
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,030
Jorah:
Have you ever
done this before?

473
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,370
No.

474
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,740
But no one else will try it,
so I'm the best you've got.

475
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,700
Have a seat.

476
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,620
I'm going to have to remove
the entire upper layer
of infected tissue,

477
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,910
then apply a medicinal
ointment to the...

478
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,740
Shh, shh!

479
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,990
Shh.

480
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:15,410
Again, I'm sorry,

481
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,910
but please try
not to scream.

482
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:19,240
They say her dragons
are bigger than Aegon's.

483
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,990
Horseshit.
Cersei's just trying
to frighten us.

484
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,580
I hope it's true.

485
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,620
If she lays siege
to King's Landing,
prices will triple.

486
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,990
As long
as we get back there
before they start.

487
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,530
One more round.
It's a long ride.

488
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,990
Hot Pie:
Arry!

489
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,200
Hello, Hot Pie.

490
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,530
Sit down.

491
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,200
Who's that for?

492
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,700
Mm. This is good.

493
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,160
You think so?

494
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,910
The secret
is browning the butter
before making the dough.

495
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:02,870
Most people don't do that
'cause it takes up
too much time.

496
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,490
Mm, I didn't do that.

497
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,030
You've been
making pies?

498
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,370
One or two.

499
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,370
I can't believe
you're here.

500
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,830
Did you meet
the big lady?

501
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:15,830
- Big lady?
- The lady knight?

502
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,030
You know,
I figured she was a knight
'cause she had armor on.

503
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,870
She was looking
for your sister,
but I told her about you.

504
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,370
Did she ever find you?

505
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,320
She found me.

506
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,870
What happened
to you, Arry?

507
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,370
You got any ale?

508
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,910
- Where you heading?
- King's Landing.

509
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,410
- Why?
- Heard Cersei's
queen now.

510
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,990
Heard she blew up
the Great Sept.

511
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,580
That must have been
something to see.

512
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,370
- Boom.
- Mm.

513
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,580
I can't believe
someone would do that.

514
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,120
Cersei would do that.

515
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,320
I thought you'd be
heading for Winterfell.

516
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,450
Why would I go there?
The Boltons have it.

517
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,910
No, the Boltons
are dead.

518
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,280
What?

519
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,450
Jon Snow came down
from Castle Black
with a wildling army

520
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:30,240
and won the Battle
of the Bastards.

521
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,660
He's King
of the North now.

522
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:34,450
You're lying.

523
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,320
Why would I lie
about that?

524
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,780
He's your brother,
right?

525
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,120
Thanks for the pie.

526
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,030
Friends don't pay.

527
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,320
Can't believe
I thought you were a boy.

528
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,240
You're pretty.

529
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,450
Thanks.

530
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,870
Take care
of yourself, Hot Pie.

531
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:05,660
Try not
to get killed.

532
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,070
Ah, I won't.

533
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,320
I'm like you, Arry.

534
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,990
I'm a survivor.

535
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,320
200 miles
to King's Landing.

536
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:19,990
One bottle of rum.
You think we'll make it?

537
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,740
Come in.

538
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,200
A raven, my king,
from the Citadel.

539
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,740
Jon:
This message was sent
to me by Samwell Tarly.

540
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:15,070
He was my brother
at the Night's Watch,

541
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,620
a man I trust as much
as anyone in this world.

542
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,410
He's discovered proof
that Dragonstone

543
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,240
sits on a mountain
of dragonglass.

544
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:33,580
I received this
a few days ago

545
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,200
from Dragonstone.

546
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:39,200
It was sent to me
by Tyrion Lannister.

547
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,580
He is now
Hand of the Queen
to Daenerys Targaryen.

548
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,620
She intends to
take the Iron Throne
from Cersei Lannister.

549
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,530
She has a powerful army
at her back

550
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,410
and, if this message
is to be believed,

551
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:55,700
three dragons.

552
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,450
Jon: Lord Tyrion
has invited me
to Dragonstone

553
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,200
to meet with Daenerys.

554
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,950
And I'm going
to accept.

555
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,280
Man: Accept?!

556
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:12,740
We need
this dragonglass,
my lords!

557
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,700
We know
that dragonglass
can destroy

558
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,620
both white walkers
and their army.

559
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,160
We need to mine it
and turn it into weapons.

560
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,530
But more importantly,
we need allies!

561
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,830
The Night King's army
grows larger by the day.

562
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,580
We can't defeat them
on our own.

563
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,410
We don't have
the numbers.

564
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,120
Daenerys has her own army
and she has dragonfire.

565
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,410
I need to try
and persuade her
to fight with us.

566
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,530
Ser Davos and I will ride
for White Harbor tomorrow,

567
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,950
then sail
for Dragonstone.

568
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,870
Have you forgotten
what happened to
our grandfather?

569
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:49,070
The Mad King invited him
to King's Landing

570
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,370
- and roasted him alive.
- I know that.

571
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,490
She is here to
reclaim the Iron Throne
and the Seven Kingdoms.

572
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,490
The North is one
of those seven kingdoms.

573
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:59,320
This isn't an invitation;
it's a trap.

574
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,620
It could be,
but I don't believe
Tyrion would do that.

575
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,990
You know him.
He's a good man.

576
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:08,830
Your Grace, with respect,
I must agree with Lady Sansa.

577
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,910
I remember the Mad King
all too well.

578
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,660
A Targaryen
cannot be trusted.

579
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,870
- Nor can a Lannister.
- All: Yeah!

580
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:20,320
Aye. We called
your brother king.

581
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,240
And then he rode south
and lost his kingdom.

582
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,030
Winter is here,
Your Grace.

583
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,910
We need
the King in the North
in the North.

584
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:34,240
Men: Aye!

585
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,990
You all crowned me
your king.

586
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:49,200
I never wanted it.

587
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,660
I never asked for it.

588
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,950
But I accepted it
because the North
is my home.

589
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:00,240
It's part of me,
and I will never
stop fighting for it,

590
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,660
no matter the odds.

591
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,320
But the odds
are against us.

592
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:12,530
None of you have seen
the Army of the Dead.
None of you.

593
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,580
We can never hope
to defeat them alone.

594
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,580
We need allies,
powerful allies.

595
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,410
I know it's a risk.

596
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,620
But I have
to take it.

597
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,370
Then send an emissary.
Don't go yourself.

598
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,910
Daenerys is a queen.

599
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:34,240
Only a king can
convince her to help us.

600
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,030
It has to be me.

601
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,990
You're abandoning
your people!

602
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,780
You're abandoning
your home.

603
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,700
I'm leaving both
in good hands.

604
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,120
- Whose?
- Yours.

605
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,620
You are my sister.

606
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:48,700
You're the only Stark
in Winterfell.

607
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,620
Until I return,
the North is yours.

608
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,740
Littlefinger:
I delivered his bones myself.

609
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,910
Presented them
to Lady Catelyn

610
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,410
as a gesture of goodwill
from Tyrion Lannister.

611
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,240
Seems like
a lifetime ago.

612
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,580
Do give Lord Tyrion my best
when you see him.

613
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,950
I was sorry
when he died.

614
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:39,660
Your father and I
had our differences,
but he loved Cat very much.

615
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,870
So did I.

616
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,320
She wasn't fond
of you, was she?

617
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,280
Well, it appears she vastly
underestimated you.

618
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,740
Your father
and brothers are gone,

619
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,780
yet here you stand,
King in the North.

620
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,490
Last best hope
against the coming storm.

621
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,660
You don't belong
down here.

622
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,450
Forgive me.

623
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,700
We haven't ever
talked... properly.

624
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,200
I wanted
to remedy that.

625
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,370
I have nothing
to say to you.

626
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,450
Not even
"thank you"?

627
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:30,700
If it weren't for me,
you'd have been slaughtered
on that battlefield.

628
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,070
You have many enemies,
my king, but I swear to you,
I'm not one of them.

629
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,740
I love Sansa,

630
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,410
as I loved her mother.

631
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,240
Touch my sister,
and I'll kill you myself.

632
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,870
- Man: Ready?
- Man #2: Ready?

633
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,910
Man #2:
Ready!

634
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,530
Come on.

635
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:37,280
- Man: Yah!
- Man #2: Come on!

636
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,200
Nymeria?

637
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,910
Nymeria,
it's me, Arya.

638
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,240
I'm heading north, girl.

639
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:58,280
Back to Winterfell.
I'm finally going home.

640
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:03,070
Come with me.

641
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,700
Come with me.

642
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,450
That's not you.

643
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,280
Nym:
You can't have them all.
It's not fair.

644
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,700
Obara:
I'm oldest.

645
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,830
Mama will want Cersei
for herself.

646
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,830
She's not my mama.

647
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:10,910
You can have Cersei.

648
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:13,450
I want the Mountain.

649
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:15,580
The Mountain
killed Father.

650
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,320
He'll crush you
with one hand.

651
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,070
Father got careless.
That's what Mama says.

652
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,280
Will you shut up
about Mama?

653
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,870
"Mama, Mama, Mama."

654
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:27,740
Maybe I'll kill you both
before we take King's Landing.

655
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:29,280
And then I won't
have to share.

656
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,990
Both:
"Mama!"

657
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,990
How can you drink
this piss?

658
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:39,120
When we reach
Sunspear,

659
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,660
I'll treat you
to a Dornish red.

660
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,070
The best
in the world.

661
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:45,490
Have you ever
been to Dorne?

662
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:47,490
A few times.

663
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:48,870
Never stayed long.

664
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,410
A boy in every port?

665
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:52,990
A boy, a girl.

666
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,910
Depends on the port.

667
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,740
Could we get
some more?

668
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:04,910
I thought
it wasn't for you.

669
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,200
I'm developing
a taste for it.

670
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,990
- He's not your servant.
- It's fine.

671
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:17,700
So, you're going to be
Queen of the Iron Islands.

672
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,530
Once I kill my uncle.

673
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,990
And what will you be,
handsome?

674
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,700
Whatever
my queen commands.

675
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,530
He'll be my advisor,
my protector.

676
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,780
Oh, I see.

677
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,200
Your protector.

678
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,490
So, if someone gets
too close to you...

679
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,280
He might have
to intervene.

680
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,070
To hold
that person back.

681
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:41,740
Until they've made
their intentions known.

682
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,030
Why are you standing
all the way over there, then?

683
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,660
A foreign invasion
is underway.

684
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,410
Leave him be.

685
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,780
Seems like you
don't need a protector.

686
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:04,700
Stay here.

687
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,660
Man: We're under attack!

688
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:34,410
Euron.

689
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,660
You mother's below deck.
Keep her safe.

690
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,240
Aah!

691
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,070
Yah!

692
00:52:58,830 --> 00:52:59,740
Aah!

693
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,120
Yah!

Yah!

695
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,830
Kill us.

696
00:53:41,830 --> 00:53:43,280
Get it over with.

697
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:09,490
Give your uncle a kiss.

698
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,240
Euron:

Ah, come on,

700
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,990
I have her.

701
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,580
Come and get her.

00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:09,410

As long as you tell me
how a Lannister

became Hand

00:04:57,448 --> 00:05:00,198
To be honest,
I was drunk for most of it.

39
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:05,365
My bannermen think
I'm a fool for coming here.

40
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:06,781
Of course they do.

41
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:09,490
If I was your Hand,
I would have advised
against it.

42
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:14,031
General rule of thumb--

43
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:17,156
Stark men don't fare well
when they travel south.

44
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:18,906
True...

45
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:21,031
but I'm not a Stark.

46
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,531
I'd say you get
used to them...

47
00:05:39,281 --> 00:05:40,739
but you never
really do.

48
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:47,531
Come, their mother
is waiting for you.

49
00:05:59,906 --> 00:06:03,490
I wondered why
you weren't there
to meet our guests.

50
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,490
You begged us to summon
the King in the North.

51
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,948
Don't you want
to see him again?

52
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:11,572
I've done my part.

53
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:13,989
I've brought
ice and fire together.

54
00:06:13,989 --> 00:06:16,281
Strange.

55
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:18,781
You spoke so highly
of Jon Snow,

56
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:22,448
but when he arrives,
you hide on a cliff.

57
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,822
I didn't take you
for a bashful girl.

58
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:29,031
My time whispering
in the ears of kings
has come to an end.

59
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,448
Oh, I doubt that.

60
00:06:31,448 --> 00:06:34,073
Give us common folk
one taste of power,

61
00:06:34,073 --> 00:06:36,906
we're like the lion
who tasted man.

62
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:40,156
Nothing is ever
so sweet again.

63
00:06:40,156 --> 00:06:43,406
Neither of us
is common folk anymore.

64
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,323
I did not part
on good terms

65
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,323
with the King in the North
or his advisor.

66
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:51,156
Why?

67
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:55,031
Because of
mistakes I made.

68
00:06:57,156 --> 00:06:59,031
Terrible mistakes.

69
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:03,989
I would only be
a distraction if I stayed.

70
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,198
- So, where will you go?
- Volantis.

71
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:08,198
Good.

72
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:10,448
If you don't mind
my saying,

73
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:14,198
I don't think you should
return to Westeros.

74
00:07:14,198 --> 00:07:16,656
I'm not sure
you'd be safe here.

75
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:21,781
Oh, I will return,
dear Spider.

76
00:07:21,781 --> 00:07:23,572
- One last time.
- My lady--

77
00:07:23,572 --> 00:07:27,156
I have to die
in this strange country.

78
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,989
Just like you.

79
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,864
Missandei:
You stand in the presence

80
00:08:12,864 --> 00:08:15,656
of Daenerys Stormborn
of House Targaryen,

81
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:17,864
rightful heir
to the Iron Throne,

82
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,822
rightful Queen of the Andals
and the First Men,

83
00:08:20,822 --> 00:08:23,240
Protector
of the Seven Kingdoms,

84
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,948
the Mother of Dragons,

85
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:27,156
the Khaleesi
of the Great Grass Sea,

86
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:30,948
the Unburnt,
the Breaker of Chains.

87
00:08:36,073 --> 00:08:37,739
This is Jon Snow.

88
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:43,531
He's King
in the North.

89
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,406
Thank you for traveling
so far, my lord.

90
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:50,656
I hope the seas
weren't too rough.

91
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,240
The winds were kind,
Your Grace.

92
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,240
Apologies, I have
a Flea Bottom accent,
I know,

93
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,114
but Jon Snow
is King in the North,
Your Grace.

94
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:00,948
- He's not a lord.
- Forgive me--

95
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:03,198
Your Grace, this is
Ser Davos Seaworth.

96
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:05,114
Forgive me,
Ser Davos.

97
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:07,739
I never did receive
a formal education,

98
00:09:07,739 --> 00:09:09,073
but I could have
sworn I read

99
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:12,365
the last
King in the North
was Torrhen Stark,

100
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:15,531
who bent the knee
to my ancestor,
Aegon Targaryen.

101
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:18,739
In exchange for his life
and the lives of the Northmen,

102
00:09:18,739 --> 00:09:23,781
Torrhen Stark swore fealty
to House Targaryen
in perpetuity.

103
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:25,281
Or do I have
my facts wrong?

104
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:27,614
I wasn't there,
Your Grace.

105
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:30,031
No, of course not.

106
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,614
But still,
an oath is an oath.

107
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,031
And perpetuity means--

108
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:37,490
what does perpetuity mean,
Lord Tyrion?

109
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,989
Forever.

110
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:41,073
Forever.

111
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:43,906
So I assume, my lord...

112
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:46,114
...you're here
to bend the knee.

113
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,198
I am not.

114
00:09:51,822 --> 00:09:53,323
Oh.

115
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:55,156
Well, that is
unfortunate.

116
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,156
You've traveled
all this way

117
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:00,323
to break faith
with House Targaryen?

118
00:10:00,323 --> 00:10:02,822
Break faith?

119
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:05,156
Your father burned
my grandfather alive.

120
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:06,864
He burned
my uncle alive.

121
00:10:06,864 --> 00:10:08,198
He would have burned
the Seven Kingdoms--

122
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:11,281
My father...
was an evil man.

123
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:15,323
On behalf
of House Targaryen...

124
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,198
I ask your forgiveness

125
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:21,156
for the crimes he committed
against your family.

126
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:24,031
And I ask you
not to judge a daughter

127
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:26,406
by the sins
of her father.

128
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:31,365
Our two houses
were allies for centuries,

129
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:33,240
and those were
the best centuries

130
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,365
the Seven Kingdoms
have ever known.

131
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:37,864
Centuries of peace
and prosperity

132
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:40,697
with a Targaryen
sitting on the Iron Throne

133
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:44,697
and a Stark serving
as Warden of the North.

134
00:10:44,697 --> 00:10:48,448
I am the last Targaryen,
Jon Snow.

135
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,864
Honor the pledge
your ancestor made to mine.

136
00:10:50,864 --> 00:10:54,531
Bend the knee
and I will name you
Warden of the North.

137
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:56,739
Together, we will
save this country

138
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,365
from those
who would destroy it.

139
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:11,240
You're right.

140
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,739
You're not guilty
of your father's crimes.

141
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:18,572
And I'm not beholden
to my ancestor's vows.

142
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:20,572
Then why are you here?

143
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:23,406
Because I need your help,
and you need mine.

144
00:11:26,614 --> 00:11:28,572
Did you see
three dragons

145
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,531
flying overhead
when you arrived?

146
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:31,614
I did.

147
00:11:31,614 --> 00:11:33,906
And did you see
the Dothraki,

148
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:36,114
all of whom have sworn
to kill for me?

149
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:38,073
They're hard to miss.

150
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:42,114
- But still,
I need your help?
- Davos: Not to defeat Cersei.

151
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:45,448
You could storm
King's Landing tomorrow
and the city would fall.

152
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:47,697
Hell, we almost took it
and we didn't even
have dragons.

153
00:11:47,697 --> 00:11:51,822
- Almost.
- But you haven't
stormed King's Landing.

154
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:53,448
Why not?

155
00:11:53,448 --> 00:11:55,156
The only reason
I can see

156
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:57,406
is you don't want to kill
thousands of innocent people.

157
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:59,448
It's the fastest way
to win the war,

158
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:01,281
but you won't do it,

159
00:12:01,281 --> 00:12:04,490
which means,
at the very least,

160
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,948
you're better
than Cersei.

161
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:10,822
Still, that doesn't explain
why I need your help.

162
00:12:12,697 --> 00:12:17,323
Because right now,
you and I and Cersei
and everyone else,

163
00:12:17,323 --> 00:12:18,948
we're children
playing at a game,

164
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:21,031
screaming that
the rules aren't fair.

165
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,156
- You told me
you liked this man.
- I do.

166
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:26,656
In the time since he's met me,
he's refused to call me queen,

167
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:29,531
he's refused to bow,
and now he's calling me
a child.

168
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:33,323
I believe he's calling
all of us children.
Figure of speech.

169
00:12:33,323 --> 00:12:36,656
Your Grace,
everyone you know will die
before winter's over

170
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,822
if we don't defeat
the enemy to the north.

171
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:41,490
As far as I can see,
you  are the enemy
to the north.

172
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,156
I am not your enemy.

173
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:46,490
The dead
are the enemy.

174
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,031
The dead?

175
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:50,906
Is that another
figure of speech?

176
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:52,531
The Army of the Dead
is on the march.

177
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:54,614
The Army of the Dead?

178
00:12:54,614 --> 00:12:56,781
You don't
know me well,
my lord,

179
00:12:56,781 --> 00:13:00,114
but do you think
I'm a liar or a madman?

180
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:02,656
No, I don't think
you're either of those things.

181
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,781
The Army of the Dead
is real.

182
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:06,240
The white walkers
are real.

183
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,156
The Night King is real.
I've seen them.

184
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,697
If they get
past the Wall

185
00:13:10,697 --> 00:13:13,198
and we're squabbling
amongst ourselves...

186
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,822
we're finished.

187
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:25,697
I was born
at Dragonstone.

188
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:30,031
Not that I can
remember it.

189
00:13:30,031 --> 00:13:33,490
We fled before
Robert's assassins
could find us.

190
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:36,697
Robert was your father's
best friend, no?

191
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:40,531
I wonder if your father knew
his best friend sent assassins

192
00:13:40,531 --> 00:13:43,073
to murder a baby girl
in her crib.

193
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:46,448
Not that it matters now,
of course.

194
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:51,531
I spent my life
in foreign lands.

195
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:53,906
So many men
have tried to kill me,

196
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:57,406
I don't remember
all their names.

197
00:13:57,406 --> 00:14:01,490
I have been sold
like a broodmare.

198
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,031
I've been chained
and betrayed,

199
00:14:05,031 --> 00:14:07,822
raped and defiled.

200
00:14:07,822 --> 00:14:10,073
Do you know
what kept me standing

201
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:13,031
through all those years
in exile?

202
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,989
Faith.

203
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,240
Not in any gods,

204
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,781
not in myths
and legends.

205
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:24,406
In myself.

206
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:27,572
In Daenerys Targaryen.

207
00:14:27,572 --> 00:14:31,114
The world hadn't seen
a dragon in centuries

208
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:33,490
until my children
were born.

209
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,281
The Dothraki hadn't
crossed the sea, any sea.

210
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:40,656
They did for me.

211
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:45,114
I was born to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

212
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:47,240
and I will.

213
00:14:49,572 --> 00:14:52,114
You'll be ruling
over a graveyard

214
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:54,448
if we don't defeat
the Night King.

215
00:14:55,864 --> 00:14:59,073
The war against my sister
has already begun.

216
00:14:59,073 --> 00:15:01,448
You can't expect us
to halt hostilities

217
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:03,281
and join you
in fighting

218
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,781
whatever you saw
beyond the Wall.

219
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,198
You don't believe him.

220
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:12,114
I understand that.
It sounds like nonsense.

221
00:15:12,114 --> 00:15:15,906
But if destiny has
brought Daenerys Targaryen
back to our shores,

222
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:19,114
it has also made Jon Snow
King in the North.

223
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:22,240
You were the first
to bring Dothraki
to Westeros?

224
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,614
He is the first
to make allies of
wildlings and Northmen.

225
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:27,697
He was named
Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

226
00:15:27,697 --> 00:15:28,781
He was named
King in the North.

227
00:15:28,781 --> 00:15:30,156
Not because
of his birthright.

228
00:15:30,156 --> 00:15:32,531
He has no birthright.
He's a damn bastard.

229
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:37,572
All those hard
sons of bitches
chose him as their leader

230
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,281
because they
believe in him.

231
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,656
All those things
you don't believe in,

232
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:44,198
he faced
those things.

233
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:46,406
He fought those things
for the good of his people.

234
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:47,989
He risked his life
for his people.

235
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,781
He took
a knife in the heart
for his people.

236
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:51,531
He gave his own--

237
00:15:57,697 --> 00:16:00,448
If we don't
put aside our enmities
and band together,

238
00:16:00,448 --> 00:16:02,531
we will die.

239
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:06,198
And then it doesn't matter
whose skeleton sits on
the Iron Throne.

240
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,531
If it doesn't matter,
then you might as well kneel.

241
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:10,697
Swear your allegiance
to Queen Daenerys,

242
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:12,323
help her to defeat
my sister,

243
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:14,490
and together, our armies
will protect the North.

244
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,240
There's no time
for that.

245
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,156
There's no time
for any of this!

246
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:19,656
While we stand here,
debating--

247
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:21,614
It takes no time
to bend the knee.

248
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,448
Pledge your sword
to her cause.

249
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,198
And why
would I do that?

250
00:16:28,073 --> 00:16:30,198
I mean no offense,
Your Grace,

251
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,406
but I don't know you.

252
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:33,240
As far as I can tell,

253
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,531
your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name,

254
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:39,864
and my own father fought
to overthrow the Mad King.

255
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:43,656
The lords of the North

256
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:46,490
placed their trust
in me to lead them,

257
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,531
and I will
continue to do so
as well as I can.

258
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:53,240
That's fair.

259
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:56,614
It's also fair
to point out

260
00:16:56,614 --> 00:17:00,739
that I'm the rightful
Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

261
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:04,490
By declaring yourself king
of the northernmost kingdom,

262
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,406
you are in
open rebellion.

263
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:18,697
Your Grace, please
dismiss your guests.

264
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:20,781
I have grave news.

265
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:25,198
You must forgive
my manners.

266
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:27,572
You'll both be tired
after your long journey.

267
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:30,323
We'll have baths drawn for you
and supper sent to your rooms.

268
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,114
Am I your prisoner?

269
00:17:45,114 --> 00:17:46,406
Not yet.

270
00:18:03,822 --> 00:18:05,531
Our ironborn
and Dornish allies

271
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:06,989
were attacked
en route to Dorne.

272
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:09,490
- And?
- Two or three
ships escaped,

273
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,822
the rest,
sunk or captured.

274
00:18:11,822 --> 00:18:14,406
Ellaria and the Sand Snakes,
dead or captured.

275
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:16,989
The Greyjoys,
dead or captured.

276
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:18,697
All of them?

277
00:18:21,948 --> 00:18:23,822
- Pull!
- Heave!

278
00:18:23,822 --> 00:18:25,198
Pull!

279
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,906
Your sister's dead?

280
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:40,448
Euron has her.

281
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:41,822
You saw him take her?

282
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:47,490
- But you got away?
- I couldn't save her.

283
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:48,989
I tried.

284
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:52,365
You wouldn't be here
if you tried.

285
00:18:56,864 --> 00:18:58,739
Man:
Come, men!

286
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,073
Sails up!

287
00:19:08,697 --> 00:19:10,697
Woman:
Murderer!

288
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:23,572
Man:
Whores!

289
00:19:23,572 --> 00:19:25,906
Traitor!

290
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:31,031
This is the life.

291
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,906
Look at them,
cheering for a Greyjoy.

292
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,822
I have to be honest,

293
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:43,781
this is making me hard.

294
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:48,490
Did you see
Little Theon's face

295
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,864
right before
he jumped overboard?

296
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:53,406
"Oh, no!"

297
00:19:53,406 --> 00:19:54,864
What a twat.

298
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:25,572
- Man: Whore! Whore! Whore!
- Man #2: Murderers!

299
00:20:58,864 --> 00:21:02,198
My queen,
please accept
this gift

300
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:06,031
on behalf of all
of your loyal subjects
in the Iron Islands.

301
00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:15,198
I give you
what no other man
could give--

302
00:21:15,198 --> 00:21:17,323
justice.

303
00:21:17,323 --> 00:21:20,989
Justice for your
murdered daughter.

304
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:34,531
You've proven yourself
the greatest captain
on the fourteen seas

305
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:37,198
and a true friend
to the crown.

306
00:21:37,198 --> 00:21:40,406
You deserve more
than a true friend.

307
00:21:40,406 --> 00:21:43,906
And you deserve
a proper reward
for your heroism.

308
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:46,572
There's only
one reward I want.

309
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:50,572
You shall have
what your heart desires...

310
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:54,156
when the war is won.

311
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:03,989
With Euron Greyjoy
commanding our naval forces

312
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,156
and Jaime Lannister
leading our armies,

313
00:22:07,156 --> 00:22:09,198
the sons and daughters
of Westeros

314
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:11,490
shall defend our country.

315
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:20,739
There's nothing
quite like it,
is there?

316
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,490
The love of the people.

317
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,614
Though I suppose
you wouldn't know.

318
00:22:24,614 --> 00:22:27,948
This same mob
spat at my sister
not long ago.

319
00:22:27,948 --> 00:22:29,697
And if you turn
on us,

320
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:32,906
they'll cheer
to see your head
mounted on a spike.

321
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:34,406
Or yours.

322
00:22:34,406 --> 00:22:37,531
They just like
severed heads, really.

323
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:40,781
Listen, if you have
any advice at all,

324
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,365
I would love to hear it.

325
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:45,406
When we have an hour or two
to speak as brothers.

326
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:47,114
Advice?

327
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:50,781
Does she like it
gentle or rough?

328
00:22:50,781 --> 00:22:52,448
A finger in the bum?

329
00:22:52,448 --> 00:22:55,739
Shh, shh, shh, shh, not now.
We'll talk later.

330
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:16,531
Cersei:
I want you to know
I understand.

331
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:18,114
Even though
we're enemies,
you and I,

332
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:19,781
I understand the fury
that drives you.

333
00:23:20,948 --> 00:23:22,281
I was there that day

334
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:24,073
when Ser Gregor crushed
your lover's head.

335
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,948
If I close my eyes,

336
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:31,948
- I can hear the sound
of Oberyn's skull breaking.

337
00:23:31,948 --> 00:23:34,156
The sound
of your scream.

338
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:35,656
I never heard
a sound like that.

339
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:37,614
I thought,
"That's true love."

340
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:41,490
Oberyn looked
beautiful that day.
He really did.

341
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,864
No one moved like him.

342
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:45,989
No one had such skill
with a spear.

343
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:49,073
Even Ser Gregor
couldn't stop him.

344
00:23:49,073 --> 00:23:51,531
If only he hadn't
taunted him.

345
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:55,490
He could've walked away
and left poor Ser Gregor
to die.

346
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,531
But that wasn't
your lover's way, was it?

347
00:23:57,531 --> 00:24:00,365
Now he's buried
somewhere.

348
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:03,114
And here's Ser Gregor,
stronger than ever.

349
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:05,031
That must be
difficult for you.

350
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,989
When my daughter
was taken from me,

351
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:14,114
my only daughter...

352
00:24:14,114 --> 00:24:16,906
well, you can't
imagine how that feels

353
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:19,156
unless you've
lost a child.

354
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:21,822
I fed her at my own breast
even though they told me

355
00:24:21,822 --> 00:24:24,531
to give her
to the wet nurse.

356
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:28,031
I couldn't bear to see her
in another woman's arms.

357
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:30,281
I never got
to have a mother,

358
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:31,697
but Myrcella did.

359
00:24:31,697 --> 00:24:35,365
She was mine,
and you took her from me.

360
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:37,406
Why did you do that?

361
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:45,365
Doesn't matter now.

362
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:56,697
Your daughter's
a beauty, too.

363
00:24:56,697 --> 00:24:59,323
Those brown eyes.

364
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:01,031
Those lips.

365
00:25:02,656 --> 00:25:04,697
Perfect Dornish beauty.

366
00:25:04,697 --> 00:25:06,572
I imagine
she's your favorite.

367
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:09,739
I know, I know,
we're not supposed
to have favorites,

368
00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:11,906
but still,
we're only human.

369
00:25:13,406 --> 00:25:14,989
We love whom we love.

370
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:19,864
I'm sorry,
I can't understand you.

371
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:23,240
That gag makes it
impossible to understand
what you're saying.

372
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,073
It must be frustrating.

373
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,240
We all make
our choices.

374
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,656
You chose to murder
my daughter.

375
00:25:33,656 --> 00:25:35,906
You must have felt powerful
after you made that choice.

376
00:25:35,906 --> 00:25:38,114
Do you feel powerful now?

377
00:25:44,697 --> 00:25:46,073
I don't sleep very well.

378
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:48,448
Not at all, really.

379
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:50,365
I lie in bed
and I stare at the canopy

380
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:52,739
and imagine ways
of killing my enemies.

381
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:56,614
How to destroy Ellaria Sand,
the woman who murdered
my only daughter.

382
00:25:58,114 --> 00:25:59,781
I thought about
having Ser Gregor

383
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:01,948
crush your skull
the way he did Oberyn's.

384
00:26:01,948 --> 00:26:06,656
It would be
poetic, I suppose,
but fast, too fast.

385
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:09,614
I thought about having him
crush your daughter's skull.

386
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:12,448
She's so beautiful.

387
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,365
The thought
of this lovely face

388
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,781
cracking open
like a duck egg,

389
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:19,531
no, it's just not right.

390
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:28,114
Mama.

391
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:40,822
Qyburn here is
the cleverest man I know.

392
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:43,906
Clever enough to learn
what poison you used
to murder Myrcella.

393
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:45,572
The Long Goodbye,
was that it?

394
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:47,656
- The Long Farewell.
- That's the one.

395
00:26:51,989 --> 00:26:53,490
How long does
the poison take?

396
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,156
Qyburn:
Difficult to say--
hours, days.

397
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,031
It depends
on the subject's
constitution.

398
00:26:58,031 --> 00:27:01,531
- But death is certain?
- Oh, yes, Your Grace,
quite certain.

399
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:09,781
Your daughter will die
here in this cell,

400
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:12,906
and you will be here
watching when she does.

401
00:27:12,906 --> 00:27:15,697
You'll be here
the rest of your days.

402
00:27:17,572 --> 00:27:21,531
If you refuse to eat,
we'll force food down
your throat.

403
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:25,240
You will live to watch
your daughter rot.

404
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,531
- To watch that
beautiful face collapse...

405
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:30,656
...to bone and dust.

406
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:35,989
All the while contemplating
the choices you've made.

407
00:27:39,073 --> 00:27:41,697
Make sure the guards
change the torches
every few hours.

408
00:27:41,697 --> 00:27:43,114
I don't want her
to miss a thing.

409
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:15,365
No.

410
00:28:57,614 --> 00:28:58,614
Don't.

411
00:29:10,656 --> 00:29:13,490
What are you doing?
No one can see us like this.

412
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,156
I am the Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.
I'll do as I please.

413
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:23,822
Forgive me, Your Grace.

414
00:29:23,822 --> 00:29:26,156
The visitor from Braavos
has arrived.

415
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:29,156
Good. And we'll need
fresh sheets for the bed.

416
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:30,490
At once, Your Grace.

417
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:43,739
No, thank you.

418
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:45,448
My condolences,
Your Grace,

419
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:47,406
on the death
of your son.

420
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:50,114
From all reports,
he was a fine young man.

421
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:52,864
The Iron Bank
didn't send you here
to offer condolences.

422
00:29:52,864 --> 00:29:56,365
Condolences
and congratulations.

423
00:29:56,365 --> 00:29:59,323
To become
the first ruling Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms,

424
00:29:59,323 --> 00:30:01,323
that's quite
an accomplishment.

425
00:30:01,323 --> 00:30:05,114
The Iron Bank appreciates
how you cast off the yoke
of superstition,

426
00:30:05,114 --> 00:30:06,697
freeing the crown
from elements

427
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:09,198
who sought to subvert
the rule of law.

428
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:12,365
The destruction
of the Sept of Baelor
was a tragic accident.

429
00:30:12,365 --> 00:30:16,572
Indeed, but sometimes
tragedies are necessary

430
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:18,948
to restore order
and rational leadership.

431
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:21,697
The Iron Bank
wants its gold back.

432
00:30:21,697 --> 00:30:24,281
Your father never
minced words either.

433
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:28,114
But, yes, your debts
are considerable.

434
00:30:28,114 --> 00:30:30,989
And you're now
engaged in a conflict
on several fronts.

435
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:33,906
We both know
how expensive
war can be.

436
00:30:33,906 --> 00:30:36,114
And we both know
gold wins wars.

437
00:30:36,114 --> 00:30:37,572
Your vaults are empty.

438
00:30:37,572 --> 00:30:40,073
Your late husband's
profligacy saw to that.

439
00:30:40,073 --> 00:30:43,406
Your wealthiest allies,
the Tyrells, are now
your enemies.

440
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:46,989
You are surrounded
on all sides by rivals
for the throne.

441
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:48,948
And the Iron Bank
wants to bet on a winner.

442
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,656
We don't make bets.

443
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:54,240
We invest in endeavors
we deem likely to be
successful.

444
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,198
A fancy way
of saying "bet."

445
00:30:57,198 --> 00:31:00,948
The war's already begun.
I've drawn first blood.

446
00:31:00,948 --> 00:31:03,948
I decapitated
the Dornish snake.

447
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:05,989
My armada owns
the Narrow Sea.

448
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,448
Euron Greyjoy's armada
owns the Narrow Sea.

449
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:09,948
Euron Greyjoy
is loyal to me.

450
00:31:09,948 --> 00:31:12,156
For now.

451
00:31:12,156 --> 00:31:15,906
Daenerys Targaryen has
three full-grown dragons.

452
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:20,240
How well do
wooden ships fare against
fire-breathing dragons?

453
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,281
Her dragons might not be
as invulnerable as some think.

454
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:27,656
But let's talk about
the Targaryen girl.

455
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:29,572
You want to
invest in her?

456
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:33,948
I'm guessing the Iron Bank
invested considerable gold
in the slave trade.

457
00:31:33,948 --> 00:31:36,198
How are your profits

458
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:38,739
now that Daenerys
has freed all the slaves?

459
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:42,906
The slave trade has
entered a downturn,
it's true.

460
00:31:42,906 --> 00:31:44,781
From what I gather,
she considers herself

461
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:48,114
more of a revolutionary
than a monarch.

462
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:52,031
In your experience,
how do bankers usually
fare with revolutionaries?

463
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:55,031
The Lannisters
owe the Iron Bank
quite a lot of money,

464
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:57,198
but Lannisters
always pay their debts.

465
00:31:57,198 --> 00:32:01,614
Do former slaves
or Dothraki or dragons?

466
00:32:05,198 --> 00:32:07,198
Your father's daughter,
indeed.

467
00:32:07,198 --> 00:32:08,531
Give me a fortnight.

468
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:10,739
Stay in King's Landing
as my honored guest.

469
00:32:10,739 --> 00:32:12,156
And when you
return to Braavos,

470
00:32:12,156 --> 00:32:16,614
I swear to you, my debt
will be paid in full.

471
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,073
I came down here to brood
over my failure to predict
the Greyjoy attack.

472
00:32:46,614 --> 00:32:48,156
You're making it
difficult.

473
00:32:48,156 --> 00:32:51,822
You look a lot better
brooding than I do.

474
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:56,073
You make me feel like
I'm failing at brooding
over failing.

475
00:32:56,073 --> 00:32:57,781
I'm a prisoner
on this island.

476
00:32:57,781 --> 00:33:01,739
I wouldn't say you're
a prisoner on this island.

477
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:03,240
You're free
to walk the castle,

478
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,156
the beaches,
to go wherever you want.

479
00:33:05,156 --> 00:33:07,323
Except to my ship.

480
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:08,739
You took my ship.

481
00:33:08,739 --> 00:33:10,697
I wouldn't say
we took your ship.

482
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,198
I'm not playing
word games with you.

483
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:15,073
The dead are coming
for us all.

484
00:33:15,073 --> 00:33:16,739
Why don't you
figure out what to do

485
00:33:16,739 --> 00:33:18,822
about my missing fleet
and murdered allies,

486
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:21,697
and I'll figure out what to do
about your walking dead men.

487
00:33:21,697 --> 00:33:23,906
It's hard
for me to fathom.
It really is.

488
00:33:23,906 --> 00:33:27,031
If someone told me
about the white walkers
and the Night King...

489
00:33:34,448 --> 00:33:35,697
You probably
don't believe me.

490
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:40,323
I do, actually.

491
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:41,864
You didn't before.

492
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:45,781
"Grumkins and snarks,"
you called them.

493
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:47,864
Do you remember?

494
00:33:47,864 --> 00:33:49,948
You said
it was all nonsense.

495
00:33:49,948 --> 00:33:53,073
It was nonsense.
Everybody knew it.

496
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,198
But then Mormont
saw them

497
00:33:56,198 --> 00:33:57,614
and you saw them.

498
00:33:57,614 --> 00:33:59,281
And I trust the eyes
of an honest man

499
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:01,281
more than I trust
what everybody knows.

500
00:34:02,614 --> 00:34:04,864
How do I convince people
who don't know me

501
00:34:04,864 --> 00:34:07,614
that an enemy
they don't believe in
is coming to kill them all?

502
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:10,948
- Good question.
- I know it's a good question.

503
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,114
I'm looking
for an answer.

504
00:34:13,114 --> 00:34:17,406
People's minds
aren't made for
problems that large.

505
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:19,864
White walkers,
the Night King,

506
00:34:19,864 --> 00:34:21,948
Army of the Dead--

507
00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:23,572
it's almost a relief
to confront

508
00:34:23,572 --> 00:34:26,448
a comfortable,
familiar monster
like my sister.

509
00:34:28,781 --> 00:34:31,739
I need to help
prepare my people
for what's coming.

510
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:35,781
I can't help them
from here.

511
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:38,531
I'd like to leave.

512
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,490
It seems unlikely that
you became King in the North

513
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,156
by giving up
that easily.

514
00:34:46,323 --> 00:34:49,448
Everyone told me to learn
from my father's mistakes.

515
00:34:49,448 --> 00:34:51,240
Don't go south.

516
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,906
Don't answer a summons
from the Mad King's daughter,

517
00:34:53,906 --> 00:34:55,323
a foreign invader.

518
00:34:57,697 --> 00:35:00,406
And here I am,

519
00:35:00,406 --> 00:35:01,948
a Northern fool.

520
00:35:01,948 --> 00:35:04,406
Children are not
their fathers,

521
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:06,114
luckily
for all of us.

522
00:35:07,614 --> 00:35:09,822
And sometimes there's more
to foreign invaders

523
00:35:09,822 --> 00:35:12,031
and Northern fools
than meets the eye.

524
00:35:12,031 --> 00:35:16,240
Daenerys could have sailed
for Westeros long ago,
but she didn't.

525
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,073
Instead, she stayed
where she was

526
00:35:18,073 --> 00:35:20,739
and saved many people
from horrible fates,

527
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:23,073
some of whom
are on this island
with us right now.

528
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:24,656
While you're
our guest here,

529
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26,198
you might consider
asking them

530
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:28,948
what they think
of the Mad King's daughter.

531
00:35:28,948 --> 00:35:32,031
She protects people
from monsters,

532
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:33,572
just as you do.

533
00:35:33,572 --> 00:35:36,031
It's why she came here.

534
00:35:36,031 --> 00:35:37,572
And she's not about
to head north

535
00:35:37,572 --> 00:35:39,031
to fight an enemy
she's never seen

536
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:41,531
on the word of a man
she doesn't know.

537
00:35:41,531 --> 00:35:43,948
After a single meeting,

538
00:35:43,948 --> 00:35:46,739
it's not a reasonable
thing to ask.

539
00:35:53,114 --> 00:35:55,365
So, do you have anything
reasonable to ask?

540
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:01,365
What do you mean?

541
00:36:01,365 --> 00:36:03,614
Maybe you are
a Northern fool.

542
00:36:03,614 --> 00:36:07,281
I'm asking
if there's something
I can do to help you.

543
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,781
- Dragonglass?
- Tyrion: Yes.

544
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:14,240
Volcanic glass,
obsidian.

545
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,240
He says you have
a tremendous amount
of it here.

546
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,031
Why are we talking
about glass?

547
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:19,906
We just lost
two of our allies.

548
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:23,281
Which is why I was
speaking to Jon Snow,
a potential ally.

549
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:29,406
And what does
the King in the North
want with dragonglass?

550
00:36:29,406 --> 00:36:31,739
Apparently, it can be
turned into weapons

551
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:34,864
that kill white walkers
and their foot soldiers.

552
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:37,031
Or stop them.

553
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:38,323
Destroy them.

554
00:36:38,323 --> 00:36:39,948
Unsure about
the nomenclature.

555
00:36:41,906 --> 00:36:44,864
And what do you think
about this Army of the Dead

556
00:36:44,864 --> 00:36:47,739
and white walkers
and Night Kings?

557
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,365
I'd very much
like to believe
that Jon Snow is wrong.

558
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:53,614
But a wise man once said
that you should never
believe a thing

559
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:56,156
simply because
you want to believe it.

560
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:02,031
Which wise man
said this?

561
00:37:02,031 --> 00:37:03,906
I don't remember.

562
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:07,323
Are you trying to present
your own statements
as ancient wisdom?

563
00:37:08,531 --> 00:37:10,739
I would never do that.

564
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:11,781
To you.

565
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:17,281
The reason
I believe Jon Snow
is because he's here.

566
00:37:17,281 --> 00:37:19,697
All of his advisors
would have told him
not to come.

567
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,781
I would have told him
not to come.

568
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,114
And he's here anyway.

569
00:37:24,114 --> 00:37:26,531
You don't
have to believe him.

570
00:37:26,531 --> 00:37:28,572
Let him mine
the dragonglass.

571
00:37:28,572 --> 00:37:30,198
If he's wrong,
it's worthless.

572
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:32,281
You didn't even know
it was here.

573
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:34,822
It's nothing to you.

574
00:37:34,822 --> 00:37:38,114
Give him something
by giving him nothing.

575
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:40,822
Take a step toward
a more productive
relationship

576
00:37:40,822 --> 00:37:43,406
with a possible ally.

577
00:37:43,406 --> 00:37:46,781
Keep him occupied
while we focus on
the task at hand--

578
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:48,156
Casterly Rock.

579
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:51,198
What was that
Ser Davos said

580
00:37:51,198 --> 00:37:55,240
about taking
a knife in the heart
for his people?

581
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,031
Did you notice that?

582
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:59,490
You must allow them
their flights of fancy.

583
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,656
It's dreary
in the North.

584
00:38:17,531 --> 00:38:19,031
Amazing thing
to see.

585
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,572
I named them
for my brothers,
Viserys and Rhaegar.

586
00:38:24,697 --> 00:38:26,198
They're both gone now.

587
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:29,864
You lost
two brothers as well.

588
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:35,906
People thought dragons
were gone forever,
but here they are.

589
00:38:37,656 --> 00:38:40,490
Perhaps we should
all be examining
what we think we know.

590
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:48,739
You've been talking
to Tyrion.

591
00:38:48,739 --> 00:38:51,490
He is my Hand.

592
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,114
- He enjoys talking.
- We all enjoy what
we're good at.

593
00:38:55,572 --> 00:38:57,073
I don't.

594
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,073
You know I'm not
going to let Cersei
stay on the Iron Throne.

595
00:39:05,073 --> 00:39:06,240
I never expected
that you would.

596
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,490
And I haven't
changed my mind

597
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,572
about which kingdoms
belong to that throne.

598
00:39:09,572 --> 00:39:11,406
I haven't either.

599
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:24,948
I will allow you
to mine the dragonglass
and forge weapons from it.

600
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:27,948
Any resources or men you need,
I will provide for you.

601
00:39:31,448 --> 00:39:32,323
Thank you.

602
00:39:38,948 --> 00:39:42,614
So you believe me, then,
about the Night King and
the Army of the Dead?

603
00:39:45,781 --> 00:39:48,490
You'd better
get to work, Jon Snow.

604
00:40:13,156 --> 00:40:14,781
How much do we have?

605
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:16,864
4,000 bushels,
my lady.

606
00:40:16,864 --> 00:40:18,031
What does
that mean?

607
00:40:18,031 --> 00:40:20,114
For the current
occupants of the castle,

608
00:40:20,114 --> 00:40:23,781
it's enough food
for a year, perhaps more.

609
00:40:23,781 --> 00:40:27,198
And what's the longest winter
in the past hundred years?

610
00:40:27,198 --> 00:40:29,656
Uh, I'm not
entirely certain.

611
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:31,490
I-I'll check
Maester Luwin's records.

612
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:34,989
He kept a copy
of every raven scroll.

613
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:37,114
You're telling me
we don't have enough food,

614
00:40:37,114 --> 00:40:40,323
especially not
if the armies of the North
come back to defend Winterfell?

615
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,822
No, my lady,
most likely not.

616
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:45,948
Then we must prepare
for that eventuality.

617
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:48,031
Whatever direction
the threat comes from,

618
00:40:48,031 --> 00:40:50,323
this is
the best place to be.

619
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,281
We need to start
building up our grain stores

620
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:54,864
with regular shipments
from every keep in the North.

621
00:40:54,864 --> 00:40:57,156
If we don't
use it by winter's end,
we'll give it back to them.

622
00:40:57,156 --> 00:40:59,490
But if the entire North
has to flee to Winterfell,

623
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:03,198
they won't have enough time
to bring wagonloads
of grain with them.

624
00:41:03,198 --> 00:41:04,614
Very wise, my lady.

625
00:41:04,614 --> 00:41:06,406
Maester Wolkan,
you'll see to it?

626
00:41:10,198 --> 00:41:12,697
Are they covering those
breastplates in leather?

627
00:41:12,697 --> 00:41:14,073
No, my lady.

628
00:41:14,073 --> 00:41:17,156
Well, shouldn't they be?
Once the real cold comes?

629
00:41:17,156 --> 00:41:18,572
They should, indeed.

630
00:41:18,572 --> 00:41:20,781
Pardon me, my lady.

631
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:23,365
You there,
why isn't there
leather on these?

632
00:41:25,365 --> 00:41:27,156
Command suits you.

633
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,948
The Northerners
are all facing north,

634
00:41:30,948 --> 00:41:33,031
worried about the threat
from beyond the Wall.

635
00:41:33,031 --> 00:41:34,572
So they should be.

636
00:41:34,572 --> 00:41:37,240
I know Cersei
better than anyone here.

637
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,323
If you turn
your back on her--

638
00:41:39,323 --> 00:41:43,240
- You don't know Cersei
better than anyone here.
- I only meant to say--

639
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,781
That the woman who
murdered my mother, father,
and brother is dangerous?

640
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:48,864
Thank you for
your wise counsel.

641
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:52,365
One of two things
will happen--

642
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:54,656
either the dead
will defeat the living,

643
00:41:54,656 --> 00:41:56,614
in which case...

644
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,697
all our troubles
come to an end,

645
00:41:58,697 --> 00:42:01,073
or life will win out.

646
00:42:01,073 --> 00:42:03,073
And what then?

647
00:42:03,073 --> 00:42:07,073
Don't fight
in the North
or the South.

648
00:42:08,656 --> 00:42:13,531
Fight every battle,
everywhere, always,
in your mind.

649
00:42:15,448 --> 00:42:17,323
Everyone is your enemy,

650
00:42:17,323 --> 00:42:20,240
everyone
is your friend...

651
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,365
every possible
series of events
is happening all at once.

652
00:42:24,365 --> 00:42:27,948
Live that way
and nothing will
surprise you.

653
00:42:27,948 --> 00:42:30,531
Everything that happens
will be something

654
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:32,448
that you've seen before.

655
00:42:34,697 --> 00:42:37,448
Lady Sansa,
at the gate.

656
00:43:09,989 --> 00:43:11,156
Hello, Sansa.

657
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:34,156
I wish Jon were here.

658
00:43:34,156 --> 00:43:37,031
Yes, I need
to speak to him.

659
00:43:41,198 --> 00:43:43,822
You're Father's
last living trueborn son.

660
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:48,531
You're Lord
of Winterfell now.

661
00:43:48,531 --> 00:43:51,781
I can never be
Lord of Winterfell.

662
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:53,614
I can never be
lord of anything.

663
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:54,864
I'm the Three-Eyed Raven.

664
00:43:56,948 --> 00:43:58,739
I don't know
what that means.

665
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:01,156
It's difficult
to explain.

666
00:44:01,156 --> 00:44:03,365
Try.
Please, for me.

667
00:44:05,073 --> 00:44:08,031
It means I can see
everything.

668
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:10,365
Everything that's
ever happened
to everyone.

669
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:13,365
Everything that's
happening right now.

670
00:44:13,365 --> 00:44:18,156
It's all pieces now,
fragments.

671
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,365
I need to learn
to see better.

672
00:44:20,365 --> 00:44:23,781
When the Long Night
comes again,

673
00:44:23,781 --> 00:44:25,406
I need to be ready.

674
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:30,864
How do you know
all this?

675
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:32,406
The Three-Eyed Raven
taught me.

676
00:44:32,406 --> 00:44:34,323
I thought you were
the Three-Eyed Raven.

677
00:44:34,323 --> 00:44:37,073
I told you
it's difficult
to explain.

678
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,739
Bran--

679
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:43,114
I'm sorry for all
that's happened to you.

680
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:47,114
I'm sorry
it had to happen
here in our home.

681
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:54,406
It was so beautiful
that night.

682
00:44:56,406 --> 00:45:00,406
Snow falling,
just like now.

683
00:45:03,656 --> 00:45:05,490
And you were
so beautiful...

684
00:45:07,448 --> 00:45:09,240
in your white
wedding dress.

685
00:45:13,114 --> 00:45:14,989
I have to go
back inside, Bran.

686
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:18,073
I'll stay
a bit longer.

687
00:45:31,781 --> 00:45:33,323
Hmm.

688
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,656
Hmm.

689
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:50,989
Does it hurt?

690
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:53,697
A bit.
Less than before.

691
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:58,114
The infection no longer
appears to be active.

692
00:45:59,697 --> 00:46:01,531
Unusual.

693
00:46:01,531 --> 00:46:02,989
Unlikely.

694
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:04,989
One could almost
be forgiven

695
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:08,572
for thinking that
the entire upper layer
of diseased skin was debrided

696
00:46:08,572 --> 00:46:12,948
and the underlying region
treated with some sort
of unguent.

697
00:46:12,948 --> 00:46:16,240
Don't know
anything about that.

698
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,323
I just started
feeling better.

699
00:46:18,323 --> 00:46:21,989
I assumed it was
the rest that did it.

700
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,572
And the climate.

701
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:28,531
The climate.

702
00:46:28,531 --> 00:46:30,323
You're free
to go, ser.

703
00:46:30,323 --> 00:46:32,365
This chamber is needed
for the infectious,

704
00:46:32,365 --> 00:46:34,073
which you are
no longer.

705
00:46:34,073 --> 00:46:37,572
Tarly, I'd like
to speak with you
in my study this evening.

706
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,822
How bad is it?

707
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:44,864
Suppose I'll find out
this evening.

708
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:52,697
Where will you go?

709
00:46:52,697 --> 00:46:56,406
I surrendered
to this sickness
the moment I first saw it.

710
00:46:57,864 --> 00:47:00,697
I knew
it would kill me

711
00:47:00,697 --> 00:47:03,365
or I'd kill myself
before it could.

712
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:06,614
Daenerys Stormborn
convinced me otherwise.

713
00:47:06,614 --> 00:47:10,240
The only place for me
is back with her.

714
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,656
I owe her my life.

715
00:47:12,656 --> 00:47:15,240
Her and you.

716
00:47:17,448 --> 00:47:19,781
Your father saved me
more than once.

717
00:47:19,781 --> 00:47:21,572
It's the least
I could do.

718
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:26,448
Perhaps our paths
will cross again.

719
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:27,864
I hope they do.

720
00:47:54,989 --> 00:47:58,448
- Ebrose:
You treated him?
- Yes.

721
00:47:58,448 --> 00:48:00,948
Who told you
to treat him?

722
00:48:00,948 --> 00:48:02,281
No one.

723
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:05,572
Who forbade you, or anyone,
to attempt to treat him?

724
00:48:05,572 --> 00:48:08,281
I seem
to remember you.

725
00:48:08,281 --> 00:48:11,114
- But you
treated him anyway?
- I did, yes.

726
00:48:12,781 --> 00:48:15,906
I forbade it
because it is dangerous
and rarely successful,

727
00:48:15,906 --> 00:48:18,240
especially on
someone of that age.

728
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,448
You could have infected
yourself and others.

729
00:48:20,448 --> 00:48:23,906
You could have devastated
the entire Citadel.

730
00:48:26,198 --> 00:48:28,114
But you didn't.

731
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:30,739
It's a meticulous,
difficult procedure.

732
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:34,156
Many maesters
whose chains are
heavy with healing links

733
00:48:34,156 --> 00:48:36,614
have attempted it
and failed.

734
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:38,697
Yet you succeeded.

735
00:48:38,697 --> 00:48:39,822
How?

736
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:45,114
I read the books
and followed the instructions.

737
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,697
That man is alive
because of you.

738
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:01,614
You should be proud.

739
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:07,198
Thank you,
Archmaester.

740
00:49:07,198 --> 00:49:08,114
Come here.

741
00:49:12,156 --> 00:49:15,822
All these manuscripts
and scrolls are rotting away.

742
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:18,490
I need you
to make copies of them.

743
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:24,864
You were expecting
a reward.

744
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:30,365
Your reward is not being
immediately expelled
from the Citadel.

745
00:49:31,531 --> 00:49:33,531
You'd better
get started.

746
00:49:33,531 --> 00:49:35,198
And careful
of the paper mites.

747
00:49:35,198 --> 00:49:36,531
They like flesh
as well.

748
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:47,156
We need to find
Euron Greyjoy's fleet
and sink it.

749
00:49:47,156 --> 00:49:50,656
Your Grace,
he's already destroyed
a good portion of our fleet.

750
00:49:50,656 --> 00:49:52,198
To send our
remaining ships
after him--

751
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,864
I'm not talking about
sending our ships after him.

752
00:49:58,697 --> 00:50:00,240
Would you have to go
yourself?

753
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,240
Euron's ships
could be anywhere

754
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,240
or in more than
one place.

755
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,656
You'd be flying around
the open seas alone

756
00:50:06,656 --> 00:50:07,697
for who knows
how long.

757
00:50:07,697 --> 00:50:09,323
I wouldn't be alone.

758
00:50:09,323 --> 00:50:11,906
I would have Drogon,
Viserion, and Rhaegal.

759
00:50:11,906 --> 00:50:13,697
What can anyone
do to them?

760
00:50:13,697 --> 00:50:15,697
Missandei:
They can still
do something to you.

761
00:50:15,697 --> 00:50:17,490
It only takes
one arrow.

762
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,031
It's too great a risk.
You're too important.

763
00:50:22,365 --> 00:50:24,490
What about
Casterly Rock?

764
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,448
The Unsullied
will be there soon.

765
00:50:26,448 --> 00:50:29,031
And what will they face?

766
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:31,448
A difficult situation.

767
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:33,572
They know we're coming.

768
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:36,906
Yes. Cersei believes
my sole purpose in life

769
00:50:36,906 --> 00:50:38,531
is to destroy
House Lannister.

770
00:50:38,531 --> 00:50:40,281
She will be ready.

771
00:50:44,281 --> 00:50:46,906
- No one has ever
taken the Rock.
- Man: Archers!

772
00:50:46,906 --> 00:50:49,281
Tyrion: The Lannister Army
is still the army
my father built.

773
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:51,614
- Come on!
- Tyrion: Well-trained
and well-provisioned.

774
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:53,406
10,000 men at least.

775
00:50:53,406 --> 00:50:54,323
They will see us coming.

776
00:50:58,948 --> 00:51:00,614
They will be ready.

777
00:51:03,906 --> 00:51:05,948
- Man: Draw! Loose!
- Man #2: Loose!

778
00:51:08,156 --> 00:51:11,281
Tyrion:
The gates of Casterly Rock
are impregnable.

779
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:21,240
The fight up the walls
will be hard.

780
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,781
We will be
at a disadvantage.

781
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:25,822
Many men will die.

782
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:30,031
Just as my father
said they would.

783
00:51:32,198 --> 00:51:34,822
Interesting thing
about my father--

784
00:51:34,822 --> 00:51:36,739
he built our house up
from near ruin.

785
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:40,906
He built our army,
he built Casterly Rock
as we know it,

786
00:51:40,906 --> 00:51:42,989
but he didn't
build the sewers.

787
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:45,073
That was beneath him,

788
00:51:45,073 --> 00:51:47,948
so he gave the job
to the lowest person
he could find--

789
00:51:47,948 --> 00:51:49,490
me.

790
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:51,323
He was right,
I was low.

791
00:51:51,323 --> 00:51:53,448
The company I kept, low.

792
00:51:53,448 --> 00:51:54,989
Women, mostly.

793
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:56,656
They weren't welcome
at the Rock.

794
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:58,948
Father disapproved
of that sort of behavior.

795
00:51:58,948 --> 00:52:00,572
Couldn't walk them
through the front gates,

796
00:52:00,572 --> 00:52:02,031
I couldn't have them
in my chambers,

797
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:04,281
so in the process
of building the sewers,

798
00:52:04,281 --> 00:52:07,031
I threw in something
for myself.

799
00:52:09,073 --> 00:52:11,073
It was a passage
that began

800
00:52:11,073 --> 00:52:12,781
in an out of the way cove
by the sea

801
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:16,198
and ended beneath
one of the main guard towers.

802
00:52:16,198 --> 00:52:19,406
No better place
for low pursuits
than beneath the ground.

803
00:52:21,031 --> 00:52:24,781
Casterly Rock
is an impregnable fortress.

804
00:52:27,031 --> 00:52:30,697
But as a good friend of mine
once said,

805
00:52:30,697 --> 00:52:34,656
"Give me 10 good men
and I'll impregnate the bitch."

806
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,406
And so it begins.

807
00:52:48,156 --> 00:52:51,031
They will face the bulk
of the Lannister forces.

808
00:52:51,031 --> 00:52:52,906
They will be outnumbered.

809
00:52:52,906 --> 00:52:55,240
They will have less armor
and fewer weapons.

810
00:53:00,198 --> 00:53:03,989
But my sister's armies
fight for her out of fear.

811
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:06,948
The Unsullied will be fighting
for something greater.

812
00:53:06,948 --> 00:53:08,948
They will be fighting
for freedom

813
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:10,739
and the person
who gave it to them.

814
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:13,240
They will be fighting
for you.

815
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,697
And that is why
they will triumph.

816
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:03,656
Where are they?!

817
00:54:03,656 --> 00:54:06,281
Where are the rest
of the Lannisters?

818
00:55:35,156 --> 00:55:37,406
- It's done.
- It is.

819
00:55:39,281 --> 00:55:43,406
And now the rains weep
o'er our halls.

820
00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:47,198
Did we fight well?

821
00:55:47,198 --> 00:55:50,240
Uh, as well
as could be expected.

822
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,365
It was never our forte.

823
00:55:52,365 --> 00:55:54,448
Golden roses, indeed.

824
00:55:56,365 --> 00:55:58,406
Your brother
and his new queen

825
00:55:58,406 --> 00:56:01,323
thought you would be
defending Casterly Rock.

826
00:56:01,323 --> 00:56:04,614
The truth is Casterly Rock
isn't worth much anymore.

827
00:56:04,614 --> 00:56:06,198
Well, it is to me,

828
00:56:06,198 --> 00:56:08,531
but my fond
childhood memories

829
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,073
won't keep Cersei
on the throne.

830
00:56:10,073 --> 00:56:12,198
So you just
let them take it?

831
00:56:12,198 --> 00:56:14,240
For now.
They won't
be able to hold it.

832
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,781
Euron Greyjoy's navy
burned their ships,

833
00:56:16,781 --> 00:56:18,781
we emptied the larders
before we left.

834
00:56:18,781 --> 00:56:21,031
Eventually,
they'll be forced
to abandon their position

835
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:24,448
and march all the way
across Westeros.

836
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:27,614
And you took your army,
your real army,

837
00:56:27,614 --> 00:56:29,490
and went
where they weren't.

838
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:32,822
As Robb Stark did to me
at Whispering Wood.

839
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,864
There are always
lessons in failures.

840
00:56:34,864 --> 00:56:38,448
Yes. You must be
very wise by now.

841
00:56:39,739 --> 00:56:42,614
My father always said
I was a slow learner.

842
00:56:42,614 --> 00:56:44,365
If he was so clever,

843
00:56:44,365 --> 00:56:46,114
why didn't he take
Highgarden

844
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:49,822
the moment
your gold mines
ran dry?

845
00:56:51,365 --> 00:56:55,281
I suppose I'll be able
to ask him myself
soon enough.

846
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:58,365
No more learning
from my mistakes, eh?

847
00:57:00,822 --> 00:57:03,323
How will you do it?

848
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:05,781
With that sword?

849
00:57:05,781 --> 00:57:08,156
That was Joffrey's sword,
wasn't it?

850
00:57:08,156 --> 00:57:10,490
Not that
he ever used it.

851
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:12,156
What did he call it?

852
00:57:13,781 --> 00:57:16,114
Widow's Wail.

853
00:57:16,114 --> 00:57:18,323
He really was a cunt,
wasn't he?

854
00:57:19,948 --> 00:57:25,323
I did unspeakable things
to protect my family.

855
00:57:25,323 --> 00:57:29,365
Or watched them
being done on my orders.

856
00:57:29,365 --> 00:57:32,531
I never lost
a night's sleep over them.

857
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:34,572
They were necessary.

858
00:57:34,572 --> 00:57:36,614
And whatever
I imagined necessary

859
00:57:36,614 --> 00:57:40,531
for the safety
of House Tyrell, I did.

860
00:57:40,531 --> 00:57:45,156
But your sister
has done things...

861
00:57:46,822 --> 00:57:49,156
I was incapable
of imagining.

862
00:57:49,156 --> 00:57:51,989
That was
my prize mistake--

863
00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:54,531
a failure
of imagination.

864
00:57:55,864 --> 00:57:58,323
She's a monster,
you do know that?

865
00:57:58,323 --> 00:58:00,490
To you, I'm sure.

866
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:02,365
To others as well.

867
00:58:02,365 --> 00:58:05,864
But after we've won
and there's no one
left to oppose us,

868
00:58:05,864 --> 00:58:10,198
when people are
living peacefully
in the world she built,

869
00:58:10,198 --> 00:58:13,906
do you really think
they'll wring their hands
over the way she built it?

870
00:58:16,323 --> 00:58:18,531
You love her.

871
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:20,323
You really do
love her.

872
00:58:20,323 --> 00:58:22,781
You poor fool.

873
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:24,531
She'll be
the end of you.

874
00:58:24,531 --> 00:58:27,073
Possibly.

875
00:58:27,073 --> 00:58:28,864
Not much
to be gained

876
00:58:28,864 --> 00:58:30,906
from discussing it
with you, though,
is there?

877
00:58:30,906 --> 00:58:33,614
What better person
to discuss it with?

878
00:58:33,614 --> 00:58:35,531
What better guarantee
could you have

879
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:39,572
that the things you say
will never leave this room?

880
00:58:39,572 --> 00:58:42,614
But perhaps
you're right.

881
00:58:42,614 --> 00:58:44,198
If she's driven you
this far,

882
00:58:44,198 --> 00:58:46,614
it's gone beyond
your control.

883
00:58:47,906 --> 00:58:49,906
Yes.

884
00:58:49,906 --> 00:58:51,365
It has.

885
00:58:52,448 --> 00:58:54,490
She's a disease.

886
00:58:54,490 --> 00:58:57,448
I regret my role
in spreading it.

887
00:58:57,448 --> 00:58:59,031
You will, too.

888
00:58:59,031 --> 00:59:00,781
I think
we're done here.

889
00:59:04,198 --> 00:59:05,240
How will it happen?

890
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:08,697
Cersei had
several ideas.

891
00:59:08,697 --> 00:59:10,114
Whipping you
through the streets

892
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:12,781
and beheading you
in front of the Red Keep.

893
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:16,614
Flaying you alive
and hanging you from
the walls of King's Landing.

894
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:21,572
I talked her
out of those.

895
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:40,240
Will there be pain?

896
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,822
No. I made sure
of that.

897
00:59:42,822 --> 00:59:44,156
That's good.

898
00:59:56,948 --> 00:59:58,948
I'd hate to die
like your son.

899
01:00:00,156 --> 01:00:01,614
Clawing at my neck,

900
01:00:01,614 --> 01:00:04,490
foam and bile spilling
from my mouth,

901
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:08,323
eyes bloodred,
skin purple.

902
01:00:08,323 --> 01:00:10,697
Must have been
horrible for you,

903
01:00:10,697 --> 01:00:14,156
as a Kingsguard,
as a father.

904
01:00:14,156 --> 01:00:16,739
It was horrible
enough for me.

905
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:19,406
A shocking scene.

906
01:00:19,406 --> 01:00:22,198
Not at all
what I intended.

907
01:00:24,156 --> 01:00:28,739
You see, I had never seen
the poison work before.

908
01:00:33,697 --> 01:00:35,864
Tell Cersei.

909
01:00:35,864 --> 01:00:38,323
I want her to know
it was me.

﻿1
00:02:09,117 --> 00:02:11,117
Man:
Hold that wagon!

2
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:27,534
You've just won
the biggest prize
in the world.

3
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:29,784
What could you possibly
have to be upset about?

4
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:33,992
Come on,
you can tell me.

5
00:02:33,992 --> 00:02:36,534
Queen of Thorns
give you one last
prick in the balls

6
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:37,867
before saying goodbye?

7
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:40,451
I'll save my confessions
for the High Septon.

8
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:42,659
There is no more
High Septon.

9
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:44,909
No, there isn't,
is there?

10
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:48,201
There is still
the question of my prize.

11
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:52,867
That's a lot of money
I just gave you.

12
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,201
It's not a castle.

13
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:58,034
How about that one?
It's available.

14
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:59,409
You don't want
Highgarden.

15
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:02,201
- I beg to differ.
- We're at war.

16
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:05,409
Daenerys Targaryen
could come and take it back
the day after you move in.

17
00:03:06,784 --> 00:03:08,659
Besides,
think of the upkeep.

18
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:11,700
The more you owe,
the more it weighs you down.

19
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,284
Oh, is that why
you're so fucking glum, eh?

20
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:16,201
All your new riches
weighing you down?

21
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:19,742
- Man: Move out!
- Jaime: They're not mine.

22
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,493
This all belongs
to the Iron Bank.

23
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,742
See?
We pay our debts.

24
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:27,576
Right,
just not to me.

25
00:03:29,451 --> 00:03:32,242
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,
formerly of...

26
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:34,700
whatever nameless
shit heap you're from

27
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,618
with a saddlebag
full of gold,

28
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:39,076
complaining about
not getting paid.

29
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:40,867
When we win this war,

30
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,742
all the castles
in the Seven Kingdoms

31
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:44,201
will be yours
to choose from,

32
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:45,618
with no one left
to take them away from you.

33
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:47,493
Yes, I'm sure
Queen Cersei's reign

34
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,950
will be quiet
and peaceable.

35
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,534
Ah, stranger things
have happened.

36
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,576
Like what?

37
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:56,576
The granaries are
being emptied and loaded
into wagons, my lord.

38
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:59,409
- The current harvest?
- We have teams of men
collecting it

39
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,076
from all the farms
in the Reach.

40
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:03,409
Ser Bronn, will you
accompany the Tarlys

41
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,576
and help them
accelerate this process?

42
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,576
I'm not much
for shoveling wheat.

43
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:12,742
No, but motivating
reluctant farmers to
hand over their harvest--

44
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:14,784
I bet you're going to have
a real talent for that.

45
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:18,618
My lord.

46
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:19,742
My lord.

47
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,950
My lord.

48
00:04:33,576 --> 00:04:35,867
Tycho:
I must say,
I don't think the Iron Bank

49
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:40,618
has ever had a debt
of this magnitude repaid
in a single installment.

50
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:44,825
I always considered
your father a very effective
and efficient man,

51
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:48,451
but you appear to be
redefining those terms
entirely.

52
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:50,659
You're too kind,
my lord.

53
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,825
I am neither kind
nor a lord, Your Grace.

54
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:56,992
I am merely an instrument
of the institution
I represent.

55
00:04:56,992 --> 00:05:00,742
Its well-being is a matter
of arithmetic, not sentiment.

56
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:03,825
And the current arithmetic
is outstanding.

57
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:07,117
- Uh, the gold...
- Is on its way.

58
00:05:07,117 --> 00:05:11,117
My brother is supervising
its transportation himself.

59
00:05:11,117 --> 00:05:14,034
Some at the Iron Bank
will be disappointed.

60
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:16,784
They've grown rather fond
of your interest payments.

61
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:20,034
We must devise a way
to raise their spirits.

62
00:05:20,034 --> 00:05:22,493
Yes, perhaps we could
be of assistance

63
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:25,284
in some
current venture.

64
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,242
My only venture
at this moment

65
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,909
is reestablishing control
over this continent

66
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:32,201
and every person on it.

67
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,034
I see a great deal
of potential in that venture.

68
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,992
I imagine it would require
outside investment.

69
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,242
It will, indeed.

70
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:43,201
I need to expand
my armies, my navies.

71
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:46,909
My Hand, Qyburn,
has made overtures to
the Golden Company in Essos.

72
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:48,117
I know them well.

73
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:50,576
They have helped us
recover significant sums

74
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:53,534
from parties who had
fallen into deep arrears.

75
00:05:53,534 --> 00:05:55,242
That's good to hear.

76
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:58,659
I, too, would like them
to recover some things
that belong to me.

77
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:02,368
Rest assured,
Your Grace,

78
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:05,284
you can count on
the Iron Bank's support.

79
00:06:05,284 --> 00:06:08,326
- Hmm.
- As soon as
the gold arrives.

80
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:13,409
Littlefinger:
This is for you.

81
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,909
The last man who wielded it
meant to cut your throat,

82
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:22,742
but your mother
fought him off.

83
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:33,576
The other dagger,

84
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:36,242
the one that
took her life,

85
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:39,451
I would have
stopped that dagger
with my own heart

86
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:40,867
if I could have.

87
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,576
I wasn't there for her
when she needed me most.

88
00:06:47,284 --> 00:06:50,284
But I am here
for her now

89
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,992
to do what she
would have done,

90
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:54,950
to protect
her children.

91
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:01,451
Anything I can do
for you, Brandon,

92
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:03,784
you need only ask.

93
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:08,992
Do you know
who this belonged to?

94
00:07:08,992 --> 00:07:11,700
No.

95
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,534
That very question was
what started the War
of the Five Kings.

96
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:19,950
In a way,
that dagger made you
what you are today.

97
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,825
Forced from your home,

98
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:24,326
driven out to the wilds
beyond the Wall.

99
00:07:24,326 --> 00:07:29,076
I imagine you've seen things
most men wouldn't believe.

100
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:41,659
To go through all of that
and make your way home again

101
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:46,284
only to find such chaos
in the world,

102
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:47,326
I can only imagine--

103
00:07:47,326 --> 00:07:49,284
Chaos is a ladder.

104
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:04,576
I'm sorry to have
disturbed you, Lord Stark.

105
00:08:04,576 --> 00:08:05,992
I'm not Lord Stark.

106
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:19,493
What's that?

107
00:08:19,493 --> 00:08:21,493
Maester Wolkan
built it for me

108
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:23,034
so I can move around
more easily.

109
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,867
It's a very good idea.

110
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,576
You're leaving.

111
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:32,534
I don't want
to leave you,

112
00:08:32,534 --> 00:08:35,534
but when--
when they come,

113
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,242
I need to be
with my family.

114
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,326
And you're safe.

115
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:42,201
Well, as safe
as anyone can be now.

116
00:08:43,326 --> 00:08:45,534
You don't
need me anymore.

117
00:08:46,618 --> 00:08:48,159
No, I don't.

118
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:53,700
That's all
you've got to say?

119
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,784
Thank you.

120
00:08:58,242 --> 00:09:00,242
Thank you?

121
00:09:00,242 --> 00:09:01,909
For helping me.

122
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:06,034
My brother
died for you.

123
00:09:06,034 --> 00:09:08,742
Hodor and Summer
died for you.

124
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:11,076
I almost died for you.

125
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:17,909
- Bran...
- I'm not, really.

126
00:09:19,867 --> 00:09:21,409
Not anymore.

127
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,867
I remember
what it felt like
to be Brandon Stark,

128
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:30,368
but I remember
so much else now.

129
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,076
You died in that cave.

130
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,867
I did.

131
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:21,284
The kitchen girl,
the redhead with the behind.

132
00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:25,950
The only thing in the kitchen
that you've put your cock in
is the liver.

133
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,284
'Ey up.
Where you going?

134
00:10:29,284 --> 00:10:31,825
In there.
I live here.

135
00:10:31,825 --> 00:10:33,534
Fuck off.

136
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,618
I'm Arya Stark.
This is my home.

137
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:41,117
Arya Stark's dead.

138
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:45,950
Send for Maester Luwin
or Ser Rodrick.

139
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:48,992
- They'll tell you who I am.
- There's no Rodrick here.

140
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:50,825
Maester's named Wolkan.

141
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:53,992
Go ask Jon Snow, then,
the King in the North.

142
00:10:53,992 --> 00:10:56,534
- He's my brother.
- He's a thousand
miles away.

143
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:59,326
Look, it's cold
and we're busy,

144
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,700
- so, you know,
best fuck off.
- Mm.

145
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,576
If Jon's gone,
who's in charge
of Winterfell?

146
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:10,742
The Lady of Winterfell.
Lady Stark.

147
00:11:10,742 --> 00:11:12,451
- Which Lady Stark?
- Henk: You tell us.

148
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:14,201
You're the one
impersonating her sister.

149
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,034
Tell Sansa
her sister's home.

150
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:24,368
Lady Sansa is too busy
to waste her breath on you,
just like us.

151
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:27,700
So, for the last time,
fuck off.

152
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,825
I'm getting into this castle
one way or another.

153
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:38,326
If I'm not who I say I am,
I won't last long.

154
00:11:38,326 --> 00:11:42,368
But if I am
and Sansa finds out
you turned me away...

155
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,576
Right, you sit there.

156
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:54,784
Right there.

157
00:11:54,784 --> 00:11:55,700
Don't move.

158
00:11:57,409 --> 00:11:59,742
Right, go tell Lady Stark.
I'll watch her.

159
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:03,076
Henk:
I ain't telling Lady Stark.
You can tell her.

160
00:12:03,076 --> 00:12:04,451
Koner:
Why me?

161
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:31,700
- Henk:
You're gonna tell her.
- I'm not.

162
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,618
'Cause if you don't,
I'm gonna hit you right
in the fucking face

163
00:12:34,618 --> 00:12:35,992
as hard as I can.

164
00:12:44,284 --> 00:12:45,742
Koner:
We told her to wait.

165
00:12:45,742 --> 00:12:48,493
We were standing
right next to her, and...

166
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:50,618
And-- and when
we turned around,
she'd gone, my lady.

167
00:12:50,618 --> 00:12:52,493
She-- she was nothing.
Some winter town girl.

168
00:12:52,493 --> 00:12:55,284
She comes in asking
for, uh, Ser Rodrick...

169
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:57,784
- Rodrick, yeah. Luwin, yeah.
- ...and Maester Luwin.

170
00:12:57,784 --> 00:13:00,201
And don't trouble yourself
over it, my lady.

171
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:03,409
- We'll-- we'll find her.
- You don't have to.

172
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:04,909
I know where she is.

173
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:23,451
Do I have to call you
Lady Stark now?

174
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:27,159
Yes.

175
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:46,576
You shouldn't have run
from the guards.

176
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,618
I didn't run.

177
00:13:48,618 --> 00:13:49,992
You need better guards.

178
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,825
It suits you...
Lady Stark.

179
00:14:00,992 --> 00:14:02,867
Jon left you
in charge?

180
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:04,242
He did.

181
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:08,159
I hope
he comes back soon.

182
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,992
I remember how happy
he was to see me.

183
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:13,326
When he sees you,
his heart will
probably stop.

184
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:25,409
It doesn't look
like him.

185
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:28,700
Should've been carved
by someone who knew his face.

186
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Everyone who knew
his face is dead.

187
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:35,201
We're not.

188
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,950
They say
you killed Joffrey.

189
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,242
Did you?

190
00:14:45,242 --> 00:14:46,909
I wish I had.

191
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:49,950
Hmm.
Me, too.

192
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,576
I was angry when I heard
someone else had done it.

193
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:57,242
However long my list got,
he was always first.

194
00:14:57,242 --> 00:14:59,159
Your list?

195
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,368
Of people
I'm going to kill.

196
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:13,992
How did you get back
to Winterfell?

197
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:15,825
It's a long story.

198
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:17,909
I imagine
yours is, too.

199
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:19,867
Yes.

200
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:21,992
Not a very
pleasant one.

201
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:23,992
Mine neither.

202
00:15:27,368 --> 00:15:29,742
But our stories
aren't over yet.

203
00:15:29,742 --> 00:15:32,618
No, they're not.

204
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,117
Arya...

205
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,825
Bran's home, too.

206
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,493
You came home.

207
00:16:39,368 --> 00:16:41,368
I saw you
at the crossroads.

208
00:16:43,201 --> 00:16:44,534
You saw me?

209
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:47,034
I see quite a lot now.

210
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:51,867
Bran has... visions.

211
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:54,034
I thought you might go
to King's Landing.

212
00:16:54,034 --> 00:16:56,284
So did I.

213
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:58,159
Why would you
go back there?

214
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,742
Cersei's on
her list of names.

215
00:17:12,284 --> 00:17:14,159
Who else
is on your list?

216
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,909
Most of them
are dead already.

217
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:29,368
Where did
you get this?

218
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:30,784
Littlefinger
gave it to me.

219
00:17:32,076 --> 00:17:34,326
Littlefinger?
He's here?

220
00:17:34,326 --> 00:17:36,201
He has declared
for House Stark.

221
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:38,076
Why would he
give you a dagger?

222
00:17:38,076 --> 00:17:40,576
- He thought
I'd want it.
- Sansa: Why?

223
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:42,284
Because it was
meant to kill me.

224
00:17:42,284 --> 00:17:47,159
The cutthroat...
after your fall?

225
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:50,034
Why would a cutthroat
have a Valyrian steel dagger?

226
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:53,076
Someone very wealthy
wanted me dead.

227
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:54,242
He's not
a generous man.

228
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:55,618
He wouldn't
give you anything

229
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:57,534
unless he thought
he was getting
something back.

230
00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:02,909
- It doesn't matter.
- What do you mean
it doesn't matter?

231
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:04,825
I don't want it.

232
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:10,159
Are you sure?

233
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:12,867
Arya:
It's Valyrian steel.

234
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,242
It's wasted
on a cripple.

235
00:18:51,034 --> 00:18:54,534
Catelyn Stark
would be proud.

236
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,909
You kept your vow.

237
00:18:56,909 --> 00:18:58,326
I did
next to nothing.

238
00:18:58,326 --> 00:19:00,242
You're too hard
on yourself, my lady.

239
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:01,825
I'm not a...

240
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:06,618
Thank you, Podrick.

241
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:27,867
Your Grace, there's still
no word from the Unsullied.

242
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,534
Soon.

243
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:31,368
He will
come back to you.

244
00:19:33,242 --> 00:19:34,576
He'd better.

245
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:39,534
What happened?

246
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:40,867
Many things.

247
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:45,409
Many things?

248
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,992
Jon: Your Grace.

249
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:18,326
I wanted you
to see it

250
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:21,076
before we start
hacking it to bits.

251
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,992
Well, this is it.
All we'll ever need.

252
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:10,493
There is something else
I want to show you,
Your Grace.

253
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:37,700
The children
of the forest
made these.

254
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,534
When?

255
00:21:45,034 --> 00:21:47,326
A very long time ago.

256
00:21:50,493 --> 00:21:52,950
They were right here,

257
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,368
standing where
we're standing.

258
00:21:55,368 --> 00:22:00,534
Before there were Targaryens
or Starks or Lannisters.

259
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:02,618
Maybe even before
there were men.

260
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,950
No.

261
00:22:15,493 --> 00:22:20,201
They were here together,
the children and the First Men.

262
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:22,409
Doing what?
Fighting each other?

263
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,992
They fought together
against their common enemy.

264
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:41,867
Despite their differences,
despite their suspicions.

265
00:22:44,034 --> 00:22:45,034
Together.

266
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:49,950
We need to do the same
if we're going to survive.

267
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:55,784
Because the enemy
is real.

268
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,034
It's always been real.

269
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:11,326
And you say
you can't defeat them

270
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:15,242
without my armies
and my dragons?

271
00:23:15,242 --> 00:23:17,867
No, I don't think I can.

272
00:23:26,076 --> 00:23:28,368
I will fight for you.

273
00:23:28,368 --> 00:23:30,242
I will fight
for the North.

274
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:36,493
When you
bend the knee.

275
00:23:42,117 --> 00:23:43,659
My people...

276
00:23:45,076 --> 00:23:47,368
won't accept
a southern ruler.

277
00:23:47,368 --> 00:23:49,909
Not after everything
they've suffered.

278
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:55,950
They will
if their king does.

279
00:23:57,618 --> 00:24:00,618
They chose you
to lead them.

280
00:24:00,618 --> 00:24:02,784
They chose you
to protect them.

281
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,618
Isn't their survival
more important than
your pride?

282
00:24:27,992 --> 00:24:30,076
What is it?

283
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:32,825
We took
Casterly Rock.

284
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:34,825
That's very good
to hear.

285
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,493
Isn't it?

286
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:50,825
You'll want
to discuss this
amongst yourselves.

287
00:24:50,825 --> 00:24:52,493
- Perhaps--
- You will stay.

288
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:55,576
All my allies are gone.

289
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,992
They've been taken from me
while I've been sitting
here on this island.

290
00:24:57,992 --> 00:25:00,534
- You still have
the largest armies.
- Who won't be able to eat

291
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:02,618
because Cersei has taken
all the food from the Reach.

292
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:04,618
Tyrion:
Call Grey Worm
and the Unsullied back.

293
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:07,409
We still have enough ships
to carry the Dothraki
to the mainland.

294
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:09,659
Commit to the blockade
of King's Landing.

295
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,700
- We have a plan.
It's still the right plan.
- The right plan!

296
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,493
Your strategy has lost us
Dorne, the Iron Islands,
and the Reach.

297
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:20,909
- If I have underestimated
our enemies--
- Our enemies?

298
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:23,159
Your family, you mean.

299
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,034
Perhaps you don't want
to hurt them after all.

300
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,950
Enough with
the clever plans.

301
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:38,618
I have three
large dragons.

302
00:25:38,618 --> 00:25:40,326
I'm going to fly them
to the Red Keep.

303
00:25:40,326 --> 00:25:41,659
We've discussed this.

304
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:44,909
My enemies
are in the Red Keep.

305
00:25:44,909 --> 00:25:48,284
What kind of a queen am I
if I'm not willing to risk
my life to fight them?

306
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:50,034
A smart one.

307
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:55,409
What do you think
I should do?

308
00:25:57,742 --> 00:25:59,992
- I would never
presume to--
- I'm at war.

309
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,034
I'm losing.

310
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,576
What do you think
I should do?

311
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,618
Jon:
I never thought that
dragons would exist again.

312
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:15,618
No one did.

313
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,742
The people
who follow you

314
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:22,909
know that you made
something impossible happen.

315
00:26:24,284 --> 00:26:25,784
Maybe that
helps them believe

316
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,950
that you can make other
impossible things happen.

317
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,909
Build a world
that's different

318
00:26:30,909 --> 00:26:33,326
from the shit one
they've always known.

319
00:26:35,576 --> 00:26:39,950
But if you use them
to melt castles
and burn cities,

320
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,576
you're not different.

321
00:26:43,284 --> 00:26:45,284
You're just
more of the same.

322
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:01,784
Don't lunge.

323
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:16,618
Don't go where
your enemy leads you.

324
00:27:18,284 --> 00:27:19,659
Brienne:
Up.

325
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,618
- And don't--
- Don't fight someone like her
in the first place.

326
00:27:33,326 --> 00:27:34,825
Nice sword.

327
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:38,451
Very nice dagger.

328
00:27:45,825 --> 00:27:48,784
If they haven't contributed
the right amount of grain
to the stores,

329
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:51,201
then I'm afraid
they'll have to make due
with what they've brought.

330
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:52,493
We can't...

331
00:27:56,825 --> 00:27:58,368
It's been a while
since I trained.

332
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:00,992
I can go and find
the master of arms
for you, my lady.

333
00:28:00,992 --> 00:28:03,867
He didn't beat
the Hound.

334
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:05,909
You did.

335
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:07,409
I want to train
with you.

336
00:28:09,493 --> 00:28:12,784
You swore to serve
both my mother's daughters,

337
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:13,909
didn't you?

338
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,201
Brienne:
Move aside, Podrick.

339
00:28:27,742 --> 00:28:30,159
You can't use that, my lady.
It's too small.

340
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,368
I won't cut you.
Don't worry.

341
00:28:33,784 --> 00:28:35,742
I'll try not to.

342
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:53,326
Who taught you
how to do that?

343
00:29:53,326 --> 00:29:54,992
No one.

344
00:30:29,618 --> 00:30:32,284
- Davos: What do you
think of her?
- Who?

345
00:30:32,284 --> 00:30:36,742
I believe you know
of whom I speak.

346
00:30:36,742 --> 00:30:39,076
I think she has
a good heart.

347
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:40,867
A good heart?

348
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:43,534
I've noticed you staring
at her good heart.

349
00:30:43,534 --> 00:30:46,368
There's no time
for that.

350
00:30:46,368 --> 00:30:49,201
I saw the Night King, Davos.
I looked into his eyes.

351
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,117
How many men do we have
in the North to fight him?

352
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:54,659
10,000? Less?

353
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,784
- Fewer.
- What?

354
00:30:56,784 --> 00:31:00,326
Speaking of good hearts--
Missandei of Naath.

355
00:31:01,451 --> 00:31:04,326
Ser Davos, Lord Snow.

356
00:31:04,326 --> 00:31:05,867
King Snow, isn't it?

357
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:07,242
No, that doesn't
sound right.

358
00:31:07,242 --> 00:31:09,117
- King Jon?
- It doesn't matter.

359
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,950
Forgive me,
but may I ask
a question?

360
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,909
Of course.

361
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:17,784
Your name is Jon Snow,
but your father's name
was Ned Stark?

362
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,950
I'm a bastard.

363
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:23,909
My mother and father
weren't married.

364
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:25,867
Is the custom
different in Naath?

365
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:27,784
We don't have
marriage in Naath,

366
00:31:27,784 --> 00:31:30,742
so the concept
of a bastard
doesn't exist.

367
00:31:30,742 --> 00:31:34,242
That sounds...
liberating.

368
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:38,451
Why did you leave
your homeland?

369
00:31:38,451 --> 00:31:41,076
I was stolen away
by slavers.

370
00:31:41,076 --> 00:31:42,576
I'm sorry.

371
00:31:42,576 --> 00:31:45,700
If I may,
how did a slave girl

372
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,950
come to advise
Daenerys Targaryen?

373
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,825
She bought me
from my master
and set me free.

374
00:31:51,825 --> 00:31:53,618
Davos:
That was good of her.

375
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:57,576
Of course, you're
serving her now,
aren't you?

376
00:31:57,576 --> 00:32:01,742
I serve my queen
because I want to
serve my queen.

377
00:32:01,742 --> 00:32:03,493
Because
I believe in her.

378
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:06,451
And if you wanted to sail
home to Naath tomorrow?

379
00:32:06,451 --> 00:32:09,784
Then she would
give me a ship
and wish me good fortune.

380
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,909
You believe that?

381
00:32:13,326 --> 00:32:14,784
I know it.

382
00:32:14,784 --> 00:32:17,784
All of us
who came with her
from Essos,

383
00:32:17,784 --> 00:32:19,493
we believe in her.

384
00:32:19,493 --> 00:32:22,159
She's not our queen
because she's the daughter

385
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,284
of some king
we never knew.

386
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:28,076
She's the queen
we chose.

387
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:31,950
Will you forgive me
if I switch sides?

388
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:39,117
Jon:
Is that a Greyjoy ship?

389
00:32:56,368 --> 00:32:57,992
Man: Halt!

390
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,201
Jon.

391
00:33:27,368 --> 00:33:28,700
I didn't know
you were here.

392
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:38,034
S-Sansa...

393
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,034
is she all right?

394
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:45,201
What you did for her...

395
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:48,534
is the only reason
I'm not killing you.

396
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,576
We heard your uncle
attacked your fleet.

397
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:02,409
We thought
you were dead.

398
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:04,034
I should be.

399
00:34:04,034 --> 00:34:05,409
Davos:
Your sister?

400
00:34:07,034 --> 00:34:09,534
Euron has her.

401
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:12,242
I came to ask the queen
to help me get her back.

402
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:16,534
The queen is gone.

403
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,867
Where did she go?

404
00:34:20,867 --> 00:34:24,451
Man: Get the horses watered!

405
00:34:40,284 --> 00:34:43,117
All the gold's safely through
the gates of King's Landing.

406
00:34:43,117 --> 00:34:44,284
Good.

407
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:45,618
We need to get
the last of these wagons

408
00:34:45,618 --> 00:34:47,700
over the Blackwater Rush
before nightfall.

409
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,409
The head of the line
is ambushed,

410
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,700
the tail will never be able
to reinforce in time.

411
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,326
Well, we are stretched
a bit thin.

412
00:34:53,326 --> 00:34:54,784
With your permission,

413
00:34:54,784 --> 00:34:57,950
flogging stragglers
has a marked effect
on mobility.

414
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,409
Let's give them
fair warning first.

415
00:35:02,409 --> 00:35:04,326
These men fought well
at Highgarden.

416
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:17,700
Man: Now, get it
on this thing.

417
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,950
Man #2: Lift!

418
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:24,950
- Ser Jaime.
- Rickon.

419
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,368
Dickon.

420
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:32,451
I hear you fought bravely
at Highgarden.

421
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:33,659
Your first battle?

422
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:37,867
And?

423
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,117
It was glorious.

424
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:41,659
Come on,
your father's
not here.

425
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:46,076
All my life,
we've been pledged
to House Tyrell.

426
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:49,326
I knew some of those men.
I hunted with them.

427
00:35:49,326 --> 00:35:52,076
They didn't
deserve to die.

428
00:35:52,076 --> 00:35:54,242
But Lady Olenna
chose to betray her queen

429
00:35:54,242 --> 00:35:56,368
and support
the Targaryen girl.

430
00:35:56,368 --> 00:35:59,326
So here we are.

431
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,493
I didn't expect it
to smell like that.

432
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,576
Men shit themselves
when they die.

433
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:05,659
Didn't they teach you that
at fancy lad school?

434
00:36:07,534 --> 00:36:09,700
Well, I learned it
when I was five.

435
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:18,909
What?

436
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:20,867
Listen.

437
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:36,326
Jaime:
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

438
00:36:36,326 --> 00:36:37,867
- What is it?
- Bronn: Get in line!

439
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:40,867
Spears and shields!
Spears and shields!

440
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:45,368
Get in line now!

441
00:36:45,368 --> 00:36:47,576
Form up!
Come on, lads!

442
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:49,159
Guard those wagons!

443
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:51,618
Form a line!
Form a line!

444
00:36:55,034 --> 00:36:56,742
Man:
Round those spears!

445
00:37:03,576 --> 00:37:05,742
Man:
Shield wall!

446
00:37:07,076 --> 00:37:08,742
Fill the gaps!

447
00:37:08,742 --> 00:37:12,076
- Randyll: Archers, steady!
- Man #2: Hold together!

448
00:37:12,076 --> 00:37:14,117
- Archers!
- Look alive!

449
00:37:14,117 --> 00:37:15,909
Get tight!

450
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:17,742
Man:
Get in line, boys!

451
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:20,159
- Ready!
- Here they come!

452
00:37:45,159 --> 00:37:47,493
Man:
Courage, lads!
Courage!

453
00:37:47,493 --> 00:37:50,409
Man #2:
Wait! Wait for it!

454
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,576
Spears out!

455
00:37:56,784 --> 00:38:00,159
- Jaime: Spears out!
- Randyll: Steady!
Hold the line!

456
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:12,451
- Get back
to King's Landing.
- I'm not abandoning my army.

457
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,784
Bronn:
You're the commander,
not a damn infantryman.

458
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,825
Those fuckers are
about to swamp us.

459
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:19,992
We can hold them off.

460
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:39,493
Dracarys!

461
00:39:17,242 --> 00:39:19,659
Jaime:
Hold the line!

462
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:21,034
Hold!

463
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:24,576
- Bronn: Hold it, lads!
- Hold the line!

464
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:30,909
Man: Throw it!

465
00:39:32,742 --> 00:39:34,201
Man: Hold!

466
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:59,076
Man:
Draw!

467
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:00,076
Loose!

468
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,201
- Archers!
- Man: Archers!

469
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,950
Archers, with me!

470
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,909
- Man: Archers, to the line!
- Man #2: To the line!

471
00:40:47,576 --> 00:40:49,284
- Nock!
- Man: Nock!

472
00:40:49,284 --> 00:40:51,784
Draw!

473
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:02,493
- Loose!
- Man: Loose!

474
00:41:09,618 --> 00:41:10,825
Man:
Run!

475
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:23,950
Qyburn's scorpion
is over there.

476
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,992
Go get it, then.

477
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,493
I can't shoot
with one hand.

478
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,493
Bronn: Come on!

479
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:45,909
Man: Need help!

480
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:49,618
Where are you?

481
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:01,700
Take cover!

482
00:45:58,117 --> 00:45:59,493
Come on, you fucker.

483
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:00,659
Dracarys.

484
00:47:14,076 --> 00:47:14,992
Flee, you idiot.

485
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,700
Come on, boy. Come on!

486
00:47:27,534 --> 00:47:30,576
You idiot.
You fucking idiot.
﻿1
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:21,074
You could've killed me.

2
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:31,533
The fuck were you doing
back there?

3
00:02:31,533 --> 00:02:33,825
Ending the war.

4
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:36,032
Killing her.

5
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:38,449
You saw the dragon
between you and her?

6
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:44,449
And?

7
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,032
Listen to me, cunt.

8
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:54,575
Till I get
what I'm owed,

9
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:56,408
a dragon doesn't
get to kill you,

10
00:02:56,408 --> 00:02:58,283
you don't
get to kill you,

11
00:02:58,283 --> 00:02:59,741
only I get
to kill you.

12
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:05,741
That was only
one of them.

13
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,575
She has two more.

14
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:11,658
If she decides to use them,
to really use them...

15
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,283
- You're fucked.
- Don't you mean
we're fucked?

16
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:16,283
No, I do not.

17
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:19,449
Dragons are where
our partnership ends.

18
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,074
I'm not gonna be around
when those things

19
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:22,825
start spitting fire
on King's Landing.

20
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:26,324
I have to tell
Cersei.

21
00:03:29,157 --> 00:03:31,116
May as well jump
back in that river.

22
00:04:45,491 --> 00:04:48,449
I know what Cersei
has told you.

23
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:53,199
That I've come
to destroy your cities,

24
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,449
burn down your homes,

25
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,199
murder you,
and orphan your children.

26
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:02,825
That's Cersei Lannister,
not me.

27
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:05,032
I'm not here
to murder,

28
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:06,783
and all I want
to destroy

29
00:05:06,783 --> 00:05:09,866
is the wheel that has
rolled over rich and poor

30
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:14,074
to the benefit of no one
but the Cersei Lannisters
of the world.

31
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:17,533
I offer you a choice--

32
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,866
bend the knee
and join me.

33
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:24,032
Together, we will leave
the world a better place
than we found it.

34
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,032
Or refuse...

35
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:28,533
and die.

36
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:59,074
Step forward,
my lord.

37
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:10,199
You will not kneel?

38
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,575
I already have
a queen.

39
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:14,283
Tyrion:
My sister.

40
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:15,491
She wasn't your queen

41
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:17,533
until recently,
though, was she?

42
00:06:17,533 --> 00:06:19,866
When she murdered
your rightful queen

43
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:22,491
and destroyed House Tyrell
for all time.

44
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,783
So it appears
your allegiances
are somewhat flexible.

45
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:29,825
There are
no easy choices in war.

46
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:32,199
Say what you will
about your sister,

47
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,700
she was born
in Westeros.

48
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,949
She's lived here
all her life.

49
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:41,783
You, on the other hand,

50
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:44,533
murdered your own father

51
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:47,658
and chose to support
a foreign invader.

52
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:50,491
One with no ties
to this land...

53
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:54,491
with an army of savages
at her back.

54
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:58,157
You will not trade
your honor for your life.

55
00:07:00,157 --> 00:07:01,616
I respect that.

56
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:04,658
Perhaps he could take
the Black, Your Grace.

57
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:07,074
Whatever else he is,
he is a true soldier.

58
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:09,324
He'd be invaluable
at the Wall.

59
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:11,658
You cannot send me
to the Wall.

60
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,658
You are not my queen.

61
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:29,449
You will have
to kill me, too.

62
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,324
Step back
and shut your mouth.

63
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:34,283
Who are you?

64
00:07:34,283 --> 00:07:35,533
A stupid boy.

65
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:38,866
I am Dickon Tarly,

66
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:40,283
son of Randyll Tarly.

67
00:07:40,283 --> 00:07:42,491
You are the future
of your house.

68
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:45,866
This war has already
wiped one great house
from the world.

69
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:47,741
Don't let it happen again.
Bend the knee.

70
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,866
I will not.

71
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,907
Your Grace,
nothing scrubs bold notions
from a man's head

72
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:06,491
like a few weeks
in a dark cell.

73
00:08:06,491 --> 00:08:09,157
I meant what I said.

74
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:10,700
I'm not here
to put men in chains.

75
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,032
If that becomes an option,
many will take it.

76
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:14,408
I gave them a choice.

77
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:17,241
They made it.

78
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:20,408
Your Grace, if you start
beheading entire families--

79
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:22,575
I'm not beheading
anyone.

80
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,408
Your Grace.

81
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,283
Daenerys:
Lord Randyll Tarly,
Dickon Tarly,

82
00:08:57,283 --> 00:08:59,949
I, Daenerys
of House Targaryen,
First of My Name,

83
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:03,074
Breaker of Chains,
and Mother of Dragons,

84
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:04,907
sentence you to die.

85
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:09,658
Dracarys.

86
00:09:57,658 --> 00:09:59,199
My-- my lord...

87
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:10,700
How many men
did we lose?

88
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:15,324
We haven't done
a full accounting.

89
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:20,491
It's not only armies
that win wars.

90
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:22,991
We have the Tyrell gold,
we have the Iron Bank
behind us.

91
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:24,658
We can buy
mercenaries.

92
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:28,449
Not the same as our men,
but they'll fight

93
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:30,658
if they're well paid,
which they will be.

94
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:34,116
I just saw
the Dothraki fight.

95
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:35,741
They'll beat
any mercenary army.

96
00:10:35,741 --> 00:10:37,825
They'll beat any army
I've ever seen.

97
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:40,700
Killing our men
wasn't war for them,
it was sport.

98
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,907
Her dragon burnt
a thousand wagons.

99
00:10:42,907 --> 00:10:45,157
Qyburn's scorpion fired
bolts bigger than you.

100
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:47,700
They couldn't stop it.
And she has three of them.

101
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:51,658
This isn't a war
we can win.

102
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:53,032
So, what do we do?

103
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:55,700
Sue for peace?

104
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,616
I sit on
her father's throne,

105
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,283
the father you betrayed
and murdered.

106
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:04,116
And in her mind,
she's winning.

107
00:11:04,116 --> 00:11:06,199
What sort of offer
do you think she'd make?

108
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:12,074
Maybe we can count on Tyrion
to intercede on our behalf

109
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:14,449
by way of apology for
murdering our father
and son.

110
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:17,700
He didn't.

111
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
You saw the crossbow,
you saw his body.

112
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,575
I'm not talking
about Father.

113
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:25,116
Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.
He had nothing to do with it.

114
00:11:25,116 --> 00:11:28,408
- After all this time,
it still amazes me that you--
- It was Olenna.

115
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:33,116
She confessed
before she died.

116
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:37,658
And this was
before or after

117
00:11:37,658 --> 00:11:40,741
she drank the poison
you so kindly provided her?

118
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,366
After.

119
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:43,866
And you believed her?

120
00:11:43,866 --> 00:11:46,616
If you were Olenna,
would you rather have seen

121
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:49,283
your granddaughter married
to Joffrey or Tommen?

122
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:54,032
Which one would Margaery
have been better able
to control?

123
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:55,575
Which one would have
made Olenna

124
00:11:55,575 --> 00:11:58,283
the true ruler
of the Seven Kingdoms?

125
00:11:58,283 --> 00:12:00,157
She was telling
the truth.

126
00:12:07,533 --> 00:12:09,741
I shouldn't have
listened to you.

127
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,324
She should have
died screaming.

128
00:12:13,324 --> 00:12:14,616
She's dead,
like her son,

129
00:12:14,616 --> 00:12:16,700
her grandchildren,
her whole house.

130
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,283
And if we don't find
a way out of this war,
we'll follow them.

131
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:22,825
So we fight and die
or we submit and die.

132
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,991
I know my choice.

133
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:27,491
A soldier
should know his.

134
00:14:34,616 --> 00:14:36,783
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

135
00:14:36,783 --> 00:14:39,575
It wasn't the word
I was thinking of, but...

136
00:14:40,825 --> 00:14:43,575
but, yes, they are.

137
00:14:43,575 --> 00:14:45,074
Gorgeous beasts.

138
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:46,991
They're not
beasts to me.

139
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:48,825
No matter
how big they get

140
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,991
or how terrifying
to everyone else,

141
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,616
they're my children.

142
00:14:58,283 --> 00:14:59,616
You weren't gone long.

143
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:01,783
No.

144
00:15:01,783 --> 00:15:03,783
And?

145
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:06,491
And I have
fewer enemies today
than I did yesterday.

146
00:15:09,157 --> 00:15:11,241
You're not sure
how you feel about that.

147
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:12,949
No, I'm not.

148
00:15:14,866 --> 00:15:16,324
How many men
did your army kill

149
00:15:16,324 --> 00:15:18,324
taking Winterfell back
from the Boltons?

150
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:20,866
Thousands.

151
00:15:20,866 --> 00:15:22,991
We both want
to help people.

152
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:26,700
We can only help them
from a position of strength.

153
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,783
Sometimes
strength is terrible.

154
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:34,658
When you first
came here,

155
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:38,408
Ser Davos said you took
a knife in the heart
for your people.

156
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,032
Ser Davos
gets carried away.

157
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:43,491
So, it was
a figure of speech?

158
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:04,866
Your Grace.

159
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:14,449
Jon Snow, this is
Ser Jorah Mormont,

160
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:16,700
an old friend.

161
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,199
I served
with your father.

162
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:20,366
He was a great man.

163
00:16:21,907 --> 00:16:23,575
You look strong.

164
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:26,741
You found a cure?

165
00:16:26,741 --> 00:16:28,700
I wouldn't be here
if I hadn't.

166
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,199
I return
to your service,
my queen,

167
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,991
if you'll have me.

168
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:37,366
It would be my honor.

169
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:18,283
Ravens.

170
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:20,116
We need to send ravens.

171
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:25,324
I put very little stock
in it myself.

172
00:18:25,324 --> 00:18:27,783
Prophecies of doom
are never in short supply,

173
00:18:27,783 --> 00:18:29,991
especially
when winter comes.

174
00:18:29,991 --> 00:18:32,324
I remember Wolkan.

175
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:34,700
A little timid,
but a sharp mind.

176
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,199
Sandhu:
Eh, the North has dulled
many good maesters' wits.

177
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:40,408
Hard to say whether
it's the cold, the drink,

178
00:18:40,408 --> 00:18:42,199
or the company.

179
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:44,366
Sandhu:
A crippled boy
claims to have seen

180
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:46,491
dead men on the march
beyond the Wall,

181
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:49,658
thanks to the magical help
of a raven with three eyes?

182
00:18:49,658 --> 00:18:51,324
Ebrose:
Yes, it is a bit much.

183
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:54,032
- Still, we ought
to write back--
- Sam: Brandon Stark.

184
00:18:57,533 --> 00:19:00,700
- The crippled boy.
- Do you know him?

185
00:19:01,866 --> 00:19:04,032
I led him through
the Wall years ago.

186
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:07,199
I saw him go
beyond the Wall.

187
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,783
And?

188
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:11,700
Somehow,
a crippled boy

189
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,783
survived for years
beyond the Wall when
no one else could.

190
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:17,533
Not the Night's Watch,
not the wildlings, no one.

191
00:19:19,157 --> 00:19:21,241
Perhaps we ought to listen
to what he has to say.

192
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:24,366
Perhaps you need
more scribing work
to discipline your mind.

193
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:27,783
I sense a more detailed
proposal is forthcoming?

194
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:42,408
Everyone in Westeros
trusts and respects you.

195
00:19:42,408 --> 00:19:46,575
If you tell people
the threat is real,
they'll believe it.

196
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:48,949
If you advise
all the lords to
send their men north

197
00:19:48,949 --> 00:19:50,907
to hold the Wall,
they'll do it.

198
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:54,408
And if you
tell every maester
in the Citadel

199
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:56,741
to search every word
of every faded scroll

200
00:19:56,741 --> 00:19:58,533
about the Long Night,

201
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,366
they may find something
that lets us defeat

202
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,283
the Army of the Dead
for good.

203
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:08,575
It could be done.

204
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,783
And this news
could be authentic.

205
00:20:12,783 --> 00:20:14,449
It's possible.

206
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,283
It's also possible
that this message

207
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:21,575
is part of a ploy
by the Dragon Queen

208
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:24,533
to lure southern armies away
from the lands they are
currently defending

209
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,575
to open those lands
to easy conquest.

210
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,283
Sandhu:
That does seem
far more likely

211
00:20:28,283 --> 00:20:30,241
than magic birds
talking to cripples.

212
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:32,783
Archmaester, please.

213
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:33,949
It's real.

214
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:36,949
I've seen it.

215
00:20:39,783 --> 00:20:41,283
We will write
to Maester Wolkan

216
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,658
at Winterfell
for clarification.

217
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:46,533
I promise you we will
get to the truth of it
one way or another.

218
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:49,241
- Archmaester, please--
- That will be all, Tarly.

219
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:51,741
Maester:
It brings to mind the work
of Jenny of Oldstones,

220
00:20:51,741 --> 00:20:54,366
the charlatan
who claimed descent from
the children of the forest.

221
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:57,157
Sandhu: Don't forget
the prophet Lodos,

222
00:20:57,157 --> 00:21:00,825
who promised that
the Drowned God would rise up
and destroy Aegon the Conqueror.

223
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:03,116
Ah, Lodos.

224
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:10,949
Is he the one
whose father and brother
were just burnt alive?

225
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,907
I'm afraid so.

226
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:14,157
Horrible business.

227
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:16,783
I haven't had the heart
to tell him yet.

228
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:18,825
He's a good lad.

229
00:21:18,825 --> 00:21:20,575
Right.

230
00:21:20,575 --> 00:21:23,491
The ravenry was falling apart
the last time I checked.

231
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,324
All rulers demand
that people bend the knee.

232
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:32,533
That's why
they're rulers.

233
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:37,658
She gave Tarly
a choice,

234
00:21:37,658 --> 00:21:40,491
a man who had taken up
arms against her.

235
00:21:40,491 --> 00:21:42,241
What else
could she do?

236
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:45,366
Not burn him alive
alongside his son?

237
00:21:45,366 --> 00:21:47,700
I am her Hand,
not her head.

238
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,949
I can't make
her decisions for her.

239
00:21:49,949 --> 00:21:53,241
That's what I used
to tell myself about
her father.

240
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:57,616
I found the traitors,
but I wasn't the one
burning them alive.

241
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,366
I was only a purveyor
of information.

242
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:09,575
It's what I told myself
when I watched them
beg for mercy--

243
00:22:09,575 --> 00:22:12,157
I'm not the one
doing it.

244
00:22:12,157 --> 00:22:14,616
When the pitch
of their screams
rose higher--

245
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:16,658
I'm not the one
doing it.

246
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:18,241
When their hair
caught fire

247
00:22:18,241 --> 00:22:21,116
and the smell
of their burning flesh
filled the throne room--

248
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:22,741
I'm not the one
doing it.

249
00:22:31,408 --> 00:22:33,616
Daenerys is not
her father.

250
00:22:33,616 --> 00:22:36,032
And she never will be

251
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,074
with the right counsel.

252
00:22:41,324 --> 00:22:43,741
You need to find a way
to make her listen.

253
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,575
- Who's that for?
- Jon Snow.

254
00:22:49,575 --> 00:22:51,116
Did you read it?

255
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:54,157
It's a sealed scroll
for the King in the North.

256
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:01,741
What's it say?

257
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:04,408
Nothing good.

258
00:23:10,907 --> 00:23:14,283
I thought
Arya was dead.

259
00:23:14,283 --> 00:23:17,366
I thought Bran
was dead.

260
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:18,783
I'm happy for you.

261
00:23:21,157 --> 00:23:22,575
You don't look happy.

262
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:24,949
Bran saw the Night King
and his army

263
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:26,949
marching towards
Eastwatch.

264
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,533
If they make it
past the Wall...

265
00:23:30,533 --> 00:23:33,241
The Wall has kept them out
for thousands of years,
presumably.

266
00:23:33,241 --> 00:23:34,907
I need to go home.

267
00:23:34,907 --> 00:23:36,616
You said you don't
have enough men.

268
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:39,199
We'll fight
with the men we have.

269
00:23:39,199 --> 00:23:40,825
Unless you'll join us.

270
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:42,991
And give the country
to Cersei?

271
00:23:42,991 --> 00:23:46,825
As soon as I march away,
she marches in.

272
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,157
Perhaps not.

273
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:52,575
Cersei thinks
the Army of the Dead
is nothing but a story

274
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:55,825
made up by wet nurses
to frighten children.

275
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:57,575
What if we
prove her wrong?

276
00:23:57,575 --> 00:24:00,991
I don't think
she'll come see
the dead at my invitation.

277
00:24:02,283 --> 00:24:04,324
So bring
the dead to her.

278
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:07,658
I thought that was what
we were trying to avoid.

279
00:24:07,658 --> 00:24:10,032
We don't have to
bring the whole army.

280
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,074
Only one soldier.

281
00:24:12,074 --> 00:24:13,991
Is that possible?

282
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:19,533
The first wight
I ever saw

283
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:22,366
was brought
into Castle Black
from beyond the Wall.

284
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:24,700
Bring one of these things
down to King's Landing

285
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,991
and show her the truth.

286
00:24:26,991 --> 00:24:29,032
Anything you bring back
will be useless

287
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:30,866
unless Cersei
grants us an audience

288
00:24:30,866 --> 00:24:33,408
and is somehow convinced
not to murder us

289
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:35,658
the moment we set foot
in the capital.

290
00:24:35,658 --> 00:24:39,241
The only person
she listens to is Jaime.

291
00:24:39,241 --> 00:24:41,074
He might listen to me.

292
00:24:45,074 --> 00:24:46,907
And how would you get
into King's Landing?

293
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,907
I can smuggle you in,

294
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:57,533
but if the gold cloaks
were to recognize you,

295
00:24:57,533 --> 00:25:00,741
I'm warning you,
I'm not a fighter.

296
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:02,157
Well, it will all
be for nothing

297
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:03,949
if we don't have
one of these dead men.

298
00:25:03,949 --> 00:25:05,324
Fair point.

299
00:25:05,324 --> 00:25:06,616
How do you propose
to find one?

300
00:25:10,032 --> 00:25:13,241
With the queen's permission,
I'll go north and take one.

301
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:18,283
You asked me
to find a cure
so I could serve you.

302
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:19,907
Allow me
to serve you.

303
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:25,408
The Free Folk
will help us.

304
00:25:25,408 --> 00:25:28,157
They know the real north
better than anyone.

305
00:25:28,157 --> 00:25:29,700
They won't follow
Ser Jorah.

306
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,907
They won't have to.

307
00:25:37,949 --> 00:25:40,366
You can't lead a raid
beyond the Wall.

308
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:42,991
You're not in
the Night's Watch anymore,
you're King in the North.

309
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:45,575
I'm the only one here
who's fought them.

310
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:47,949
I'm the only one here
who knows them.

311
00:25:49,324 --> 00:25:51,324
I haven't given you
permission to leave.

312
00:25:54,157 --> 00:25:57,533
With respect, Your Grace,
I don't need your permission.

313
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:58,741
I am a king.

314
00:26:00,366 --> 00:26:01,783
And I came here

315
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:03,616
knowing that you could
have your men behead me

316
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:06,825
or your dragons
burn me alive.

317
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:11,241
I put my trust
in you, a stranger,

318
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:14,241
because I knew it was
the best chance
for my people,

319
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:16,408
for all our people.

320
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:22,283
Now I'm asking you
to trust in a stranger...

321
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:26,491
because it's
our best chance.

322
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:48,825
Glover:
The King in the North
should stay in the North.

323
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:55,741
We did not choose you
to rule us, my lady.

324
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:58,575
- But perhaps
we should have.

325
00:27:01,074 --> 00:27:05,866
The Knights of the Vale
came here for you,
Lady Stark.

326
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:07,324
Men: Aye.

327
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:15,199
You are very kind,
my lords.

328
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:17,241
But Jon is our king.

329
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:19,783
He is doing what
he thinks is best.

330
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,741
Sansa:
I warned Jon
this would happen.

331
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:33,408
That he couldn't
leave the North

332
00:27:33,408 --> 00:27:36,241
and expect it to just sit
and wait for him like Ghost.

333
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:38,616
He didn't.
He trusted you
to hold it for him.

334
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,408
Well, he's not making it easy.
The Northern lords are proud.

335
00:27:46,074 --> 00:27:48,366
These are Mother
and Father's chambers.

336
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,907
And?

337
00:27:52,616 --> 00:27:54,949
Nothing.

338
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:57,741
Don't do that.

339
00:27:57,741 --> 00:28:00,241
- What?
- Say what you mean.

340
00:28:01,907 --> 00:28:04,366
You always liked
nice things.

341
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:08,074
They made you feel
better than everyone.

342
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,575
Are you angry with me?

343
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:16,907
They were insulting Jon,

344
00:28:16,907 --> 00:28:18,283
and you sat there
and listened.

345
00:28:18,283 --> 00:28:19,783
I listened
to their complaints,

346
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,825
which is my responsibility
as Lady of Winterfell.

347
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:25,783
Their opinions
are important to you.

348
00:28:25,783 --> 00:28:28,491
Glover has 500 men,
Royce has 2,000.

349
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:31,449
Offend them
and Jon loses his army.

350
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:33,449
Not if they lose
their heads first.

351
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:40,074
Winterfell didn't just
fall into our hands.

352
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:41,949
We took it back,

353
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:43,907
and the Mormonts
and the Hornwoods

354
00:28:43,907 --> 00:28:45,366
and the wildlings
and the Vale.

355
00:28:45,366 --> 00:28:46,907
All of us,
working together.

356
00:28:46,907 --> 00:28:51,241
Now, I'm sure
cutting off heads
is very satisfying,

357
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:54,783
but that's not the way
you get people to
work together.

358
00:28:57,949 --> 00:29:00,241
And if Jon
doesn't come back,

359
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:02,199
you'll need
their support...

360
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:04,324
so you can
work together

361
00:29:04,324 --> 00:29:06,283
to give you
what you really want.

362
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:08,866
How can you even think
such a horrible thing?

363
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:13,616
You're thinking it
right now.

364
00:29:15,616 --> 00:29:18,575
You don't want to be,

365
00:29:18,575 --> 00:29:20,866
but the thought
just won't go away.

366
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:28,658
I have work to do.

367
00:29:32,324 --> 00:29:33,616
My lady.

368
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,907
Last time I was here,
I killed my father
with a crossbow.

369
00:29:48,907 --> 00:29:51,866
Last time I was here,
you killed my son
with wildfire.

370
00:29:55,032 --> 00:29:57,866
There's a path to the left
that hugs the cliff.

371
00:29:57,866 --> 00:30:00,533
The guards
hardly ever patrol it.

372
00:30:00,533 --> 00:30:01,907
Too many steps.

373
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:08,074
You're not
staying here?

374
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:11,575
I've got my own business
in Flea Bottom.

375
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:13,408
What if someone
takes the boat?

376
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:15,700
Then we're fucked.
Best hurry.

377
00:30:21,116 --> 00:30:22,533
We don't have time
for this.

378
00:30:22,533 --> 00:30:24,700
We should be preparing
the city for a siege.

379
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,866
The Dothraki
are coming.

380
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,991
All the more reason
for you to train.

381
00:30:27,991 --> 00:30:29,991
Unless you plan on fighting
Dothraki 12-year-olds.

382
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:32,533
Well, I seem to recall them
giving you a bit of
trouble as well.

383
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,533
And here I am,
ready to train.

384
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,491
Why down here?

385
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:38,324
I don't think
you want people to see

386
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:41,241
how you look swinging
that thing yet.

387
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:44,032
Today might be the day
I kill you by accident.

388
00:30:44,032 --> 00:30:46,575
Oh, you won't be
swinging it at me.

389
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:56,449
I'll leave you
to it.

390
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:01,575
I needed to see you.

391
00:31:03,032 --> 00:31:04,866
And I knew you'd
never agree to meet.

392
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:11,366
You made me look
like a complete fool.

393
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:13,658
I thought I'd surprise you
by hitting Casterly Rock,

394
00:31:13,658 --> 00:31:16,616
but you were
three steps ahead of me.

395
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:19,199
Abandoned the family home,
completely unsentimental.

396
00:31:19,199 --> 00:31:20,700
Father would have
been proud.

397
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,449
- Don't talk about Father.
- Listen to me--

398
00:31:22,449 --> 00:31:23,949
I once told Bronn

399
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,783
that if I ever
saw you again,
I'd cut you in half.

400
00:31:29,783 --> 00:31:32,283
It'll take you a while
with a sparring sword.

401
00:31:41,449 --> 00:31:43,366
He was going
to execute me.

402
00:31:43,366 --> 00:31:46,074
He knew
I was innocent.

403
00:31:46,074 --> 00:31:48,408
He didn't hate me
because of anything I did,

404
00:31:48,408 --> 00:31:50,783
he hated me
because of what I am.

405
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,949
A little monster
sent to punish him.

406
00:31:55,825 --> 00:31:58,032
Did he--
did he think--

407
00:31:58,032 --> 00:31:59,825
did he think I wanted
to be born this way?

408
00:31:59,825 --> 00:32:01,700
- Did he think I chose it--
- What do you want?!

409
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:09,783
Daenerys will
win this war.

410
00:32:12,157 --> 00:32:13,575
You're
a military man.

411
00:32:13,575 --> 00:32:16,324
You must know
there's no way
around that.

412
00:32:18,366 --> 00:32:19,949
Daenerys
is not her father.

413
00:32:19,949 --> 00:32:22,825
She's even willing
to suspend the hostilities

414
00:32:22,825 --> 00:32:25,324
if Cersei agrees
to certain terms.

415
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:27,866
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

416
00:32:27,866 --> 00:32:29,324
you can ask her
yourself.

417
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,700
I-- I don't.
And Daenerys doesn't.

418
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:34,825
Not right now,
anyway.

419
00:32:36,991 --> 00:32:39,241
She has a more
important request.

420
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:20,949
I wasn't sure
I'd find you.

421
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:30,241
Thought you might
still be rowing.

422
00:33:33,866 --> 00:33:36,949
I looked in shops,
taverns, brothels.

423
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:40,241
Should have known
to come straight to
the Street of Steel.

424
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:42,741
Aren't you worried
about the gold cloaks?

425
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:44,157
Haven't been here
in years.

426
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,575
Why should
they recognize me?

427
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:49,241
Sometimes I hardly do.

428
00:33:50,907 --> 00:33:53,074
Nothing fucks you
harder than time.

429
00:33:57,866 --> 00:33:59,949
Anybody give you
any trouble?

430
00:33:59,949 --> 00:34:02,408
Here I am,
arming Lannisters,

431
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:04,283
and I never get
a second look.

432
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:05,783
But you were right.

433
00:34:05,783 --> 00:34:08,324
Safest place for me was
right under the queen's nose.

434
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:09,825
Don't be so sure.

435
00:34:09,825 --> 00:34:12,741
Safety is never a permanent
state of affairs.

436
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:16,491
Bad things are coming.

437
00:34:18,991 --> 00:34:21,949
You came to get me.
You want me to come with you.

438
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,074
- Well, the thing you need
to understand is--
- I'm ready.

439
00:34:24,074 --> 00:34:25,533
- You--
- Let's go.

440
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:27,449
You should know
what you're heading into.

441
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,449
What do you think
I've been thinking about

442
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,825
with every swing
of the hammer?

443
00:34:30,825 --> 00:34:33,283
How happy I am
making weapons

444
00:34:33,283 --> 00:34:35,741
for the family
that killed my father?

445
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,449
The family that
tried to kill me?

446
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:41,825
I've been getting ready.

447
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:43,283
I never knew what for,

448
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:45,825
but I've always known
I'd know it when it comes.

449
00:34:47,491 --> 00:34:50,575
You might want to bring
one of those swords.

450
00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:52,491
I don't know much
about swinging swords.

451
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,324
But this...

452
00:34:57,157 --> 00:34:58,491
this I know.

453
00:35:07,575 --> 00:35:08,991
Keep your father's name
to yourself.

454
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:11,783
Situation's complicated
enough already.

455
00:35:13,157 --> 00:35:14,825
Well, who should
I say I am?

456
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,074
I told you, Clovis,
if we don't get out
of here soon,

457
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:22,575
- someone's going to--
- Gold cloak: You there!

458
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:27,533
No weapons, friends.
I promise.

459
00:35:28,741 --> 00:35:30,199
What can I do
for you?

460
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:32,700
- Is that your boat?
- It is.

461
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,116
- Gold cloak:
The docks are that way.
- Davos: That they are.

462
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:36,616
I try to stay
away from them

463
00:35:36,616 --> 00:35:38,866
to avoid good men
such as yourselves.

464
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:44,866
- Still five gold dragons?
- Are you joking?

465
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:47,116
You must be even older
than you look.

466
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:49,032
- 15.
- 15?!

467
00:35:49,032 --> 00:35:50,157
Apiece.

468
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,700
I can't say
it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

469
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,575
Gold cloak #2:
What's in the boat?

470
00:36:10,116 --> 00:36:11,283
Not more gold.

471
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:13,032
- Wine?
- Mm.

472
00:36:13,032 --> 00:36:15,032
- I like wine.
- Or hams.

473
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:18,074
Come have a look.

474
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:28,533
- Fermented crab.
- What?

475
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,408
Davos:
Fermented crab.

476
00:36:30,408 --> 00:36:33,408
One bucket of this
triples a brothel's
earnings for the week.

477
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,366
A man thinks
he's done.

478
00:36:35,366 --> 00:36:37,949
He's ready to go back
to his loving family.

479
00:36:37,949 --> 00:36:39,866
But before he gets
his breeches up,

480
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:43,241
his lady of the hour pops
a tiny spoon of that
into his mouth.

481
00:36:43,241 --> 00:36:46,783
Five minutes later,
he's back in the race.

482
00:36:46,783 --> 00:36:49,283
Here, have a taste.

483
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:03,825
I'd hurry to your
favorite establishment,

484
00:37:03,825 --> 00:37:06,324
or you'll put a hole
in that chainmail.

485
00:37:33,324 --> 00:37:35,324
Oi, dwarf!

486
00:37:36,658 --> 00:37:38,199
I really wouldn't
try any more

487
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,241
until you see how
the first bite hits you.

488
00:37:40,241 --> 00:37:42,116
That dwarf...

489
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:43,741
Where'd you get
that scar?

490
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:46,283
Fish hook.
Some men you just
can't teach.

491
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:49,366
We was looking
for a dwarf with a scar
like that a while back.

492
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:51,408
Davos:
Perhaps there's
some arrangement?

493
00:37:53,825 --> 00:37:55,783
Arrangement?

494
00:37:55,783 --> 00:37:58,991
You gonna arrange to pay us
more than Queen Cersei--

495
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:08,533
This is Gendry.

496
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:10,032
He'll do.

497
00:38:12,741 --> 00:38:13,741
Go, go, go.

498
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:18,032
Qyburn:
I could give you something.

499
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:19,533
That won't
be necessary.

500
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,074
Ser Jaime.

501
00:38:32,032 --> 00:38:34,700
Why was Qyburn here?

502
00:38:36,116 --> 00:38:38,366
He's the Hand of the Queen.
Why are you here?

503
00:38:43,032 --> 00:38:45,575
I met with Tyrion.

504
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:56,199
What did our brother
have to say?

505
00:38:58,783 --> 00:39:01,241
Daenerys
wants to meet.

506
00:39:01,241 --> 00:39:03,866
To discuss
her surrender?

507
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:05,700
To discuss
an armistice.

508
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,491
She's just won a great victory.
Why would she want a truce now?

509
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:10,241
Because an army
of dead men

510
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:12,783
is marching
on the Seven Kingdoms.

511
00:39:15,283 --> 00:39:17,116
Tyrion claims
he'll have proof.

512
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,366
- Are you going
to punish him?
- Tyrion?

513
00:39:23,366 --> 00:39:24,866
Bronn.

514
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,783
He betrayed you.

515
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:32,157
He set up a meeting
without your knowledge
or consent.

516
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:37,283
Do you think
anything of importance

517
00:39:37,283 --> 00:39:39,783
happens in this city
without me knowing?

518
00:39:39,783 --> 00:39:43,032
You let it happen.
Why?

519
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:45,700
I've come
to believe that

520
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,408
an accommodation
with the Dragon Queen

521
00:39:48,408 --> 00:39:50,949
could be in our
immediate interest.

522
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:54,283
She has the numbers.
If we want to beat her,
we have to be clever.

523
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:56,449
We have to fight her
like Father would have.

524
00:39:59,907 --> 00:40:03,074
Dead men, dragons,
and Dragon Queens...

525
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:08,116
Whatever stands
in our way,

526
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,866
we will defeat it.

527
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:12,658
For ourselves,
for our house,

528
00:40:12,658 --> 00:40:14,658
for this.

529
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:28,866
Who will you say
is the father?

530
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:30,157
You.

531
00:40:36,074 --> 00:40:37,324
People won't like that.

532
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:45,366
Do you remember
what Father used
to say about people?

533
00:40:45,366 --> 00:40:49,324
The lion does not
concern himself with
the opinions of the sheep.

534
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,199
Never betray me again.

535
00:41:10,283 --> 00:41:12,199
Davos:
We're leaving today.

536
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:15,783
- The king's got
a lot on his mind.
- I understand.

537
00:41:15,783 --> 00:41:18,366
He doesn't need to be
thinking about harboring
the bastard of a dead king.

538
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:20,825
- You don't
have to worry.
- You're just Clovis,

539
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:23,157
a smith who's come
to pay his respects

540
00:41:23,157 --> 00:41:26,157
before he heads off to work
at the Winterfell forges.

541
00:41:26,157 --> 00:41:28,157
Understood.

542
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:31,783
Begging your pardon,
Your Grace.

543
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:33,241
You survived
King's Landing.

544
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,241
Yet again.
Your Grace,
this is Clo--

545
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:38,658
Name's Gendry,
Your Grace.

546
00:41:38,658 --> 00:41:40,241
I'm Robert Baratheon's son.

547
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:41,366
Bastard son.

548
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:46,907
He was meant
to keep that to himself.

549
00:41:46,907 --> 00:41:48,741
Our fathers
trusted each other.

550
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:50,074
Why shouldn't we?

551
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:54,866
I saw your father once
at Winterfell.

552
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:58,074
I met yours
in my shop.

553
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:02,116
- You're a lot leaner.
- And you're a lot shorter.

554
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:15,991
I grew up on
stories about them.

555
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,991
All I ever knew is that
they fought together and won.

556
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:23,533
Ser Davos told me
where you're going,
Your Grace, and why.

557
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:25,324
Let me come
with you.

558
00:42:25,324 --> 00:42:27,199
Don't be a fool.
You're not a soldier.

559
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,032
No,
but I'm a fighter.

560
00:42:29,032 --> 00:42:32,116
And he won't be
needing a smith
with a sword like that.

561
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:36,032
You know
how to use one?

562
00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:38,408
Well,
that's a problem.

563
00:42:38,408 --> 00:42:39,949
I prefer a hammer.

564
00:42:42,949 --> 00:42:44,658
He can handle himself.

565
00:42:46,449 --> 00:42:48,533
We could use the help.

566
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,408
As my father
used to say,

567
00:42:50,408 --> 00:42:52,491
"It's better to be
a coward for a minute,

568
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:54,741
than dead for
the rest of your life."

569
00:42:54,741 --> 00:42:57,157
I owe you my life.

570
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,949
Twice over.

571
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:02,199
But if what you said is true
about what's up there,

572
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:04,658
I can't wait out
this war.

573
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:10,366
Yeah, nobody mind me.

574
00:43:10,366 --> 00:43:14,408
All I've ever done
is live to a ripe old age.

575
00:43:14,408 --> 00:43:16,324
Man:
All right, come on.

576
00:43:25,907 --> 00:43:28,157
Tyrion:
You may not believe it,

577
00:43:28,157 --> 00:43:30,866
but I've missed you,
Mormont.

578
00:43:30,866 --> 00:43:33,991
Nobody glowers
quite like you.

579
00:43:33,991 --> 00:43:35,283
Not even Grey Worm.

580
00:43:41,074 --> 00:43:43,032
This is the coin
the slaver gave me

581
00:43:43,032 --> 00:43:46,032
when I suggested he free us
and pay us, remember?

582
00:43:46,032 --> 00:43:49,866
It was supposed to last us
the rest of our lives.

583
00:43:54,324 --> 00:43:55,700
Take it with you.

584
00:43:58,366 --> 00:43:59,866
But bring it back.

585
00:43:59,866 --> 00:44:01,032
Our queen needs you.

586
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:12,866
We should be better
at saying farewell by now.

587
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:16,032
Your Grace, I...

588
00:44:33,449 --> 00:44:35,700
If I don't return,
at least you won't
have to deal

589
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,032
with the King
in the North anymore.

590
00:44:39,366 --> 00:44:41,241
I've grown used to him.

591
00:44:43,324 --> 00:44:45,949
I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come,
Your Grace.

592
00:44:55,032 --> 00:44:56,700
Heave!

593
00:45:19,825 --> 00:45:24,283
Gilly: Do you know
how many steps there are
in the Citadel?

594
00:45:24,283 --> 00:45:25,491
No.

595
00:45:25,491 --> 00:45:28,449
15,782.

596
00:45:33,032 --> 00:45:36,449
Guess how many windows are
in the Great Sept of Baelor.

597
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:41,116
None anymore.

598
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:42,783
That's true.

599
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:47,116
This High Septon Maynard,
he recorded everything.

600
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:49,324
He even recorded
his own bowel movements.

601
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:56,074
What does
"annulment" mean?

602
00:45:56,074 --> 00:45:59,949
It's when a man
sets aside his lawful wife.

603
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:05,324
Maynard says here that
he issued an annulment
for a Prince "Ragger"

604
00:46:05,324 --> 00:46:08,825
and remarried him
to someone else
at the same time

605
00:46:08,825 --> 00:46:11,366
in a secret ceremony
in Dorne.

606
00:46:11,366 --> 00:46:13,283
Is that a common thing
in the south or--?

607
00:46:13,283 --> 00:46:14,658
These maesters...

608
00:46:16,533 --> 00:46:20,116
they set me to the task
of preserving that man's
window counting

609
00:46:20,116 --> 00:46:22,408
and annulments
and bowel movements
for all eternity,

610
00:46:22,408 --> 00:46:24,199
while the secret to
defeating the Night King's

611
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,866
probably sitting on
some dusty shelf somewhere,
completely ignored.

612
00:46:26,866 --> 00:46:28,783
But that's all right,
isn't it?

613
00:46:28,783 --> 00:46:32,866
We can all become
slavering, murderous imbeciles
in thrall to evil incarnate

614
00:46:32,866 --> 00:46:34,491
as long as we can have access
to the full records

615
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:38,533
of High Septon Maynard's
15,782 shits!

616
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:42,491
Steps.

617
00:46:45,533 --> 00:46:47,658
That number
was the steps.

618
00:48:09,616 --> 00:48:12,199
Are you sure
you want to do this?

619
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:14,616
You always wanted
to be a maester.

620
00:48:16,241 --> 00:48:20,408
I'm tired of reading about
the achievements of better men.

621
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:51,366
Wolkan:
I found it, my lord.

622
00:49:55,074 --> 00:49:56,783
It, uh, took
some searching.

623
00:49:56,783 --> 00:49:58,866
Maester Luwin's archives
are very thorough.

624
00:50:03,575 --> 00:50:06,199
You're sure
this is the only copy
in Winterfell?

625
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:08,074
Uh, yes, my lord.

626
00:50:12,866 --> 00:50:14,783
Lady Stark thanks you
for your service.

627
00:52:46,907 --> 00:52:48,783
Tormund:
Isn't it your job
to talk him out

628
00:52:48,783 --> 00:52:50,783
of stupid
fucking ideas
like this?

629
00:52:50,783 --> 00:52:53,575
I've been failing
at that job of late.

630
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:57,241
How many queens
are there now?

631
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:58,575
Two.

632
00:52:58,575 --> 00:53:01,741
And you need to convince
the one with the dragons

633
00:53:01,741 --> 00:53:03,575
or the one who
fucks her brother?

634
00:53:05,408 --> 00:53:06,408
Both.

635
00:53:06,408 --> 00:53:08,449
How many men
did you bring?

636
00:53:11,533 --> 00:53:13,074
Jon:
Not enough.

637
00:53:13,074 --> 00:53:14,700
The big woman?

638
00:53:18,032 --> 00:53:20,825
We were hoping
some of your men
could help.

639
00:53:20,825 --> 00:53:23,658
- Hmm.
- I'll be staying behind.

640
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,783
I'm a liability out there,
as you well know.

641
00:53:26,783 --> 00:53:27,783
You are.

642
00:53:30,575 --> 00:53:33,783
You really want
to go out there?
Again?

643
00:53:40,074 --> 00:53:41,825
You're not
the only ones.

644
00:53:45,449 --> 00:53:48,949
My scouts found them
a mile south of the Wall.

645
00:53:48,949 --> 00:53:50,825
Said they were
on their way here.

646
00:53:57,658 --> 00:53:59,116
You're the Hound.

647
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:02,949
I saw you once
at Winterfell.

648
00:54:08,658 --> 00:54:10,825
They want to go
beyond the Wall, too.

649
00:54:10,825 --> 00:54:14,116
We don't want to go
beyond the Wall,
we have to.

650
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:16,283
Our Lord told us that
the Great War is coming--

651
00:54:16,283 --> 00:54:18,491
Gendry:
Don't trust him.

652
00:54:18,491 --> 00:54:20,449
Don't trust
any of them.

653
00:54:26,074 --> 00:54:27,700
They're the Brotherhood.

654
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:30,283
And the last thing
their lord told them to do

655
00:54:30,283 --> 00:54:32,658
was sell me to a red witch
to be murdered.

656
00:54:32,658 --> 00:54:34,366
Jorah:
Thoros?

657
00:54:39,408 --> 00:54:41,491
I hardly
recognized you.

658
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:43,700
Ser Jorah Mormont.

659
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,658
They won't give me anything
to drink down here.

660
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,700
I haven't been feeling
like myself.

661
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,533
Tormund:
You're a fucking Mormont?

662
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:54,658
Like the last
Lord Commander?

663
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,866
He was my father.

664
00:54:56,866 --> 00:54:59,866
He hunted us
like animals.

665
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:02,907
You returned the favor,
as I recall.

666
00:55:04,575 --> 00:55:07,199
Here we all are

667
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:08,783
at the edge
of the world

668
00:55:08,783 --> 00:55:10,366
at the same moment,

669
00:55:10,366 --> 00:55:12,866
heading in the same direction
for the same reason.

670
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:16,949
Our reasons
aren't your reasons.

671
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:19,324
It doesn't matter
what we think our reasons are.

672
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:23,324
There's a greater
purpose at work.

673
00:55:23,324 --> 00:55:26,616
And we serve it
together,

674
00:55:26,616 --> 00:55:28,907
whether we
know it or not.

675
00:55:28,907 --> 00:55:31,825
We may take the steps,
but the Lord of Light--

676
00:55:31,825 --> 00:55:35,199
For fuck's sake,
will you shut your hole?

677
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,991
Are we coming
with you or not?

678
00:55:37,991 --> 00:55:40,199
Don't you want to know
what we're doing?

679
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:44,616
Is it worse than sitting
in a freezing cell,
waiting to die?

680
00:55:44,616 --> 00:55:46,616
He's right.

681
00:55:46,616 --> 00:55:48,616
We're all
on the same side.

682
00:55:51,116 --> 00:55:52,241
How can we be?

683
00:55:53,866 --> 00:55:55,949
We're all breathing.


﻿1
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,250
- You all right?
- Mm.

2
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,460
Ever been north
before?

3
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,130
Never seen snow
before.

4
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,000
Beautiful, eh?

5
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,540
I can breathe again.

6
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,710
Down south,
the air smells
like pig shit.

7
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,330
You've never been
down south.

8
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,250
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

9
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,790
Gendry:
How do you live
up here?

10
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,670
How do you keep your balls
from freezing off?

11
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,170
Tormund:
You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

12
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:57,210
Walking's good,
fighting's better,
fucking's best.

13
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,670
There's not a living woman
within a hundred miles
of here.

14
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,040
We have to make do
with what we've got.

15
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,250
This one is maybe
not so smart.

16
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,170
Davos says
he's a strong fighter.

17
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,670
Good.
That's more important
than being smart.

18
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,880
Smart people
don't come up here
looking for the dead.

19
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,710
Tormund:
So, you met
this Dragon Queen, huh?

20
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,080
And?

21
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,460
She'll only
fight beside us
if I bend the knee.

22
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,880
You spent too much time
with the Free Folk.

23
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,580
Now you don't
like kneeling.

24
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,880
Mance Rayder
was a brave man.

25
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,710
A proud man.

26
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,540
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

27
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,540
How many of his people
died for his pride?

28
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,880
You still mad
at us, boy?

29
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,920
You sold me to a witch.

30
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,330
A priestess.

31
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,250
I'll admit,
it is a subtle distinction.

32
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,420
We're fighting a great war.
Wars cost money.

33
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,290
I wanted to be
one of you.

34
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,330
I wanted to
join the Brotherhood,
but you sold me off

35
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,290
like a slave.

36
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,290
Do you know
what she did to me?

37
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,880
She strapped me
down on a bed,

38
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,710
- she stripped me naked...
- Sounds all right so far.

39
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,460
- ...and put leeches on me.
- Was she naked, too?

40
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,920
She needed
your blood.

41
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,580
Yes, thank you.
I know that.

42
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,540
- Could have been worse.
- She wanted to kill me!

43
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,710
- They would have killed me
if wasn't for Davos.
- But they didn't, did they?

44
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,460
So, what you
whinging about?

45
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,130
I'm not whinging.

46
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,080
Your lips are moving
and you're complaining
about something.

47
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,130
That's whinging.

48
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,920
This one's been
killed six times.

49
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,630
You don't hear him
bitching about it.

50
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,250
Good lad.

51
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,460
Jon: The first time
I went north of the Wall
was with your father.

52
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,080
He was a good man.

53
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,210
He deserved
a better son.

54
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,250
Were you with him
at the end?

55
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,330
I was a prisoner
of the wildlings.

56
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,330
But we avenged him.

57
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,830
I want you
to know that.

58
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,830
Every mutineer
found justice.

59
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,670
Can't think
of a worse way
for him to go.

60
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,170
The Night's Watch
was his life.

61
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,000
He would have died
to protect every one
of those men.

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,460
And they butchered him.

63
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,670
I hate that
he died that way.

64
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,330
My father was
the most honorable man
I ever met.

65
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,130
He was good
all the way through.

66
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,380
And he died on
the executioner's block.

67
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,540
Your father wanted
to execute me, you know?

68
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,080
I heard.

69
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,380
He was in the right,
of course.

70
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,880
Didn't make me
hate him any less.

71
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,880
- I'm glad he didn't
catch you.
- Me, too.

72
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,130
Your father
gave me this sword.

73
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:16,670
Changed the pommel
from a bear to a wolf...

74
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,920
but it's still
Longclaw.

75
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,210
Lord Commander Mormont

76
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:32,830
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

77
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,710
But you are back,

78
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,670
and it's been
in your family
for centuries.

79
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,460
It's not right
for me to have it.

80
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,040
He gave it to you.

81
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,250
I'm not his son.

82
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,420
I brought shame
onto my house.

83
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,130
I broke
my father's heart.

84
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,420
I forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

85
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,250
It's yours.

86
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,380
May it serve you well...

87
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,420
and your children
after you.

88
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,130
Father used to watch us
from up here.

89
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,630
He wouldn't say much.

90
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,000
You probably
don't remember.

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You were inside
knitting all the time.

92
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,750
I remember.

93
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,830
One time, the boys
were shooting arrows
with Ser Rodrik.

94
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,460
I came out here after,

95
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,710
and Bran had
left his bow behind,

96
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,330
just lying
on the ground.

97
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,710
Ser Rodrik would have
cuffed him if he saw.

98
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,290
There was one arrow
in the target.

99
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,960
There was no one around,
just like now.

100
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,830
No one to stop me.

101
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:24,460
So I started shooting.

102
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,830
And every shot,
I had to go up there

103
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,130
and get my one arrow
and walk back and
shoot it again.

104
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,380
I wasn't very good.

105
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Finally,
I hit the bull's-eye.

106
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,330
Could have been
the 20th shot or the 50th.

107
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,790
I don't remember.

108
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:45,210
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this.

109
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,130
I looked up,

110
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,880
and he's standing
right here,

111
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,540
smiling down at me.

112
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,130
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

113
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,540
But he was smiling,
so I knew it wasn't wrong.

114
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,080
The rules were wrong.

115
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,750
I was doing what I was
meant to be doing,
and he knew it.

116
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,380
Now he's dead.

117
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,130
Killed by
the Lannisters

118
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,750
with your help.

119
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,670
What?

120
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,630
That's your
pretty handwriting.

121
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,460
Septa Mordane
used to crack my knuckles

122
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,210
'cause I couldn't write
as well as you.

123
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,250
"Robb, I write to you today
with heavy heart.

124
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,420
Our good King Robert
is dead,

125
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,250
killed from wounds
he took in a boar hunt."

126
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,750
You don't have
to read it.
I remember.

127
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,460
"Father has been
charged with treason.

128
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,420
He conspired
with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey

129
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,250
and tried to steal
his throne.

130
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,080
The Lannisters
are treating me well

131
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,080
and providing me
with every comfort.

132
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,420
I beg you,
come to King's Landing,

133
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,290
swear fealty
to King Joffrey,

134
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,500
and prevent any strife
between the great houses

135
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,290
of Lannister
and Stark.

136
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,500
Your faithful sister,
Sansa."

137
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,920
They forced me
to do it.

138
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,080
Did they?

139
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,380
With a knife
at your throat?

140
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,830
Did they put you
on a rack and stretch you

141
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,540
until your bones
started to pop?

142
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,460
You don't know
what it was like.
I was a child.

143
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,290
So was I.
I would have let them kill me
before I betrayed my family.

144
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,130
They told me it was
the only way to save Father.

145
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,670
And you were stupid enough
to believe them.

146
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,630
I remember you
standing on that platform
with Joffrey and Cersei

147
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,330
when they dragged
Father to the block.

148
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,960
I remember the pretty dress
you were wearing.

149
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,330
I remember the fancy way
you did your hair.

150
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,290
You were there?

151
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,580
I was there.

152
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,460
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

153
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,250
And what did you do?

154
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,670
Did you come
running to the rescue?

155
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,460
Did you fight off
the Lannisters and
save Father?

156
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,080
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't,
just like me.

157
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,670
I didn't betray him.
I didn't betray Robb.

158
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:05,330
I didn't betray
our entire family
for my beloved Joffrey.

159
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,670
You should be
on your knees,
thanking me.

160
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,540
We're standing
in Winterfell again
because of me.

161
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,750
You didn't win it back,
Jon didn't win it back.

162
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,830
He lost the Battle
of the Bastards.

163
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,580
The Knights of the Vale
won the battle,

164
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,210
and they rode north
for me.

165
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,500
While you were off, where?
Traveling the world?

166
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,330
- I was training.
- Training.

167
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,210
Well, while
you were training,

168
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,460
I suffered things
you could never imagine.

169
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,080
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

170
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,830
You never would have
survived what I survived.

171
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,420
I guess
we'll never know.

172
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,380
What are you going to do
with that letter?

173
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,330
I don't know yet.

174
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,670
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

175
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,750
You're scared,
aren't you?

176
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,880
What are you
scared of?

177
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
You didn't commit
any crimes.

178
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,710
- No one's going to hang you.
- Well, Arya--

179
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,170
You're scared
I'll show it to Jon
and he'll be angry.

180
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,540
No, that's not Jon.
He'll understand.

181
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,500
You were just
a scared little girl,

182
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,710
all alone with
the wicked Lannisters.

183
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,580
Do you know how happy
Cersei would be right now
if she saw us fighting?

184
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,580
This is exactly
what she wants.

185
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,670
This is what
she's always wanted--
to tear us apart.

186
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,250
You're scared
the Northern lords
will read it.

187
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,460
They wouldn't think much
of Lady Sansa

188
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,460
if they knew how she did
Cersei's bidding.

189
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,460
What would little
Lyanna Mormont say?

190
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,630
She's younger than you were
when you wrote this.

191
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,130
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child?"

192
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,710
You're angry.

193
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,920
Sometimes anger
makes people do
unfortunate things.

194
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,540
Sometimes
fear makes them do
unfortunate things.

195
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,420
I'll go with anger.

196
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,330
You're the one
they call "the Dog."

197
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,170
Fuck off.

198
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:30,960
They told me
you were mean.

199
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,380
Were you born mean
or you just hate wildings?

200
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,750
I don't give two shits
about wildings.

201
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,460
It's gingers I hate.

202
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,330
Gingers are beautiful.

203
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,920
We are kissed by fire,
just like you.

204
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,830
Don't point
your fucking finger at me.

205
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,210
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

206
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,960
I didn't trip,
I was pushed.

207
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,880
And ever since,
you've been mean.

208
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,500
Will you fuck off?

209
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,460
I don't think
you're truly mean.

210
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,000
You have sad eyes.

211
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:05,000
You want to suck my dick,
is that it?

212
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,710
- Dick?
- Cock.

213
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,710
Ah, dick.

214
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,000
I like it.

215
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,040
I bet you do.

216
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,670
Nope,
it's pussy for me.

217
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,670
I have a beauty waiting for me
back at Winterfell.

218
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,790
If I ever
get back there.

219
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,540
Yellow hair,
blue eyes,

220
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,750
the tallest woman
you've ever seen.

221
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,210
Almost as tall
as you.

222
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,540
- Brienne of Tarth.
- You know her?

223
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,880
You're with Brienne
of fucking Tarth?

224
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,250
Well, not with her yet.

225
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,880
- But I see
the way she looks at me.
- How does she look at you?

226
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,330
Like she wants
to carve you up
and eat your liver?

227
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,080
You do know her.

228
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,540
We've met.

229
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,670
I want to make
babies with her.

230
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:50,670
Think of them--
great big monsters.

231
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,250
They'd conquer
the world.

232
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,830
How did
a mad fucker like you
live this long?

233
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,580
I'm good
at killing people.

234
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,130
You don't look
much like him.

235
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,580
Who's that?

236
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,630
Your father.

237
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,710
I suppose you favor
your mother.

238
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,080
You knew him?

239
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,880
'Course I did.

240
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,460
When he was Hand,

241
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,830
he sent me off hunting
for the Mountain.

242
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,290
Your wildling friend
told me

243
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,580
the red woman
brought you back.

244
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,750
Thoros has
brought me back
six times.

245
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,830
We both serve
the same lord.

246
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,750
I serve the North.

247
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,790
The North didn't
raise you from the dead.

248
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,790
The Lord of Light
never spoke to me.

249
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,170
I don't know
anything about him.

250
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,790
I don't know
what he wants from me.

251
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,170
- He wants you alive.
- Why?

252
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,580
I don't know.

253
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,960
That's all
anyone can tell me--
"I don't know."

254
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,790
So, what's the point
in serving a god

255
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,290
if none of us knows
what he wants?

256
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,000
I think about that
all the time.

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,080
I don't think
it's our purpose
to understand.

258
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,460
Except one thing--
we're soldiers.

259
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,130
We have to know
what we're fighting for.

260
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:04,330
I'm not fighting
so some man or woman
I barely know

261
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,380
can sit on a throne
made of swords.

262
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,790
So, what are you
fighting for?

263
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:10,960
Life.

264
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,290
Death is the enemy.

265
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,580
The first enemy
and the last.

266
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,500
But we all die.

267
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,830
The enemy always wins.

268
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,080
And we still need
to fight him.

269
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,040
That's all I know.

270
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,500
You and I
won't find much joy
while we're here,

271
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,750
but we can keep
others alive.

272
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,540
We can defend those
who can't defend themselves.

273
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,750
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men."

274
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,580
Maybe we don't
need to understand
any more than that.

275
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,790
Maybe that's enough.

276
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,040
Aye.

277
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,500
Maybe that's enough.

278
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,880
That's what I saw
in the fire.

279
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,080
A mountain
like an arrowhead.

280
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,420
Thoros:
Are you sure?

281
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,880
We're getting close.

282
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,880
Daenerys:
Do you know
what I like about you?

283
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,380
- I honestly don't.
- You're not a hero.

284
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,920
Oh.

285
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,710
Well, I've been heroic
on occasion.

286
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,500
I once charged
through the Mud Gate
of King's Landing and--

287
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,290
I don't want you
to be a hero.

288
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,580
Heroes do stupid things
and they die.

289
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,630
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

290
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,920
even this...
Jon Snow--

291
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,580
they all try
to outdo each other.

292
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,750
Who can do the stupidest,
bravest thing.

293
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,750
It's interesting,
these heroes you name.

294
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,960
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

295
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,880
even this...
Jon Snow.

296
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,000
They all
fell in love with you.

297
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,960
- Jon Snow's
not in love with me.
- Oh, my mistake.

298
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,670
I suppose he stares
at you longingly

299
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,580
because he's
hopeful for a successful
military alliance.

300
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,540
He's too little for me.

301
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,380
I didn't mean--

302
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,540
As heroes go,
he is quite little.

303
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,960
I know you're brave.

304
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,920
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

305
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,830
So, if all goes well,

306
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,130
I'll finally get
to meet your sister.

307
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,460
From everything
you've told me about her,

308
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,790
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

309
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,630
Oh, first,
she'd torture you
in some horrible way,

310
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,750
then she'd murder you.

311
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,670
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

312
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,460
But if we go
to the capital,

313
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,290
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

314
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:01,040
Anyone touches you,
King's Landing burns
down to the foundation stones.

315
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,080
And right now,
she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

316
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,670
Of course she is.

317
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:06,960
And she's wondering
what trap you're laying
for her.

318
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,420
Are we?

319
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,580
Laying any traps?

320
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,920
If we want to create
a new and better world,

321
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,040
I'm not sure
deceit and mass murder
is the best way to start.

322
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,830
Which war was won without
deceit and mass murder?

323
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,630
Yes, you'll need
to be ruthless

324
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,500
if you're going
to win the throne.

325
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,540
You need to inspire
a degree of fear.

326
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,920
But fear
is all Cersei has.

327
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,750
It's all my father had,
and Joffrey.

328
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,670
It makes
their power brittle

329
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,460
because everyone beneath them
longs to see them dead.

330
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,000
Aegon Targaryen got
quite a long way on fear.

331
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,670
He did.

332
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,290
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

333
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,750
Aegon built a wheel.

334
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,960
If that's the kind of queen
you want to be,

335
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,540
how are you different
from all the other tyrants
that came before you?

336
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,960
So we walk
into the lions' den.

337
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,630
My brother promised me
he'd keep a grip

338
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,250
on the Lannister forces.

339
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,130
Forgive me,
but I don't care about
any Lannister promises.

340
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,420
Except yours.

341
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,540
And I promised him

342
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,080
I'd keep you from doing
anything impulsive.

343
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,880
Impulsive?

344
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:19,130
This will be
a difficult negotiation.

345
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,670
We're sitting down
with people who want
to see us both headless.

346
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,170
My sister is likely
to say something
provocative.

347
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,710
- And?
- And you have been known

348
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,880
to lose your temper
from time to time,

349
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,210
as all great leaders do.

350
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,630
When have I lost
my temper?

351
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,170
Burning the Tarlys,
for instance.

352
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,710
That was not impulsive.

353
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,540
That was necessary.

354
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,460
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

355
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,040
Perhaps the father
needed to die and not the son.

356
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,750
Perhaps they both needed time
to contemplate their mistakes

357
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,040
in the solitude
of a cold cell.

358
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,460
We had no time to discuss
the possibilities

359
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,500
before you ended
their possibilities.

360
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,210
One could be forgiven
for thinking you're taking

361
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,040
your family's side
in this debate.

362
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,880
I am taking
their side.

363
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,580
You need to take
your enemy's side

364
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
if you're going to see
things the way they do.

365
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,540
And you need to see things
the way they do

366
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,580
if you're going to
anticipate their actions,

367
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:11,920
respond effectively,
and beat them.

368
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,250
Which I want you
to do very much.

369
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,750
Because I believe in you
and in the world you want
to build.

370
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,420
But the world
you want to build

371
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,000
doesn't get built
all at once.

372
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,130
Probably not
in a single lifetime.

373
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,960
How do we ensure
that your vision endures?

374
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,920
After you break the wheel,
how do we make sure
it stays broken?

375
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,790
You want to know who sits
on the Iron Throne
after I'm dead.

376
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,830
Is that it?

377
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,540
You say you can't
have children,

378
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,830
but there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

379
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,960
The Night's Watch
has one method.

380
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,330
The ironborn,
for all their many flaws,
have another.

381
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,040
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

382
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,790
Your Grace, I saw
hundreds of arrows

383
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,130
fly towards you
when you fought on
the Blackwater Rush,

384
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,210
and I saw hundreds
of arrows miss.

385
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,830
But any one of them
could have found your heart
and ended your--

386
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,000
You've been thinking about
my death quite a bit,
haven't you?

387
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,580
Is this one of the items
you discussed

388
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,290
with your brother
in King's Landing?

389
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:09,750
I'm trying to serve you
by planning for the long term.

390
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,330
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

391
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,380
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

392
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,670
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

393
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,670
Look!

394
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,580
The Hound:
A bear.

395
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,710
Big fucker.

396
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:23,540
Do bears have
blue eyes?

397
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,040
We have to get him
back to Eastwatch.

398
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,750
Flask.

399
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,040
Go on.

400
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,920
You all right?

401
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,670
I just got bit
by a dead bear.

402
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:18,420
Aye, you did.

403
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,210
Funny old life.

404
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,960
Right, then.

405
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,880
We're off.

406
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:57,000
- Where did she get it?
- I don't know.

407
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,130
She seems
very resourceful.

408
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,210
You're worried.

409
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,880
We're asking
20,000 men

410
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,630
to fight with us
in the worst winter
any of them have ever seen.

411
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:11,630
The weather will be
the least of their problems.

412
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,420
Many of them
will be happy to find
a good reason to go home.

413
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,920
- You question their loyalty?
- Their loyalty is to Jon.

414
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,540
Jon is not here.
I haven't heard
from him in weeks.

415
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,580
You're the Lady
of Winterfell.

416
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,290
The king chose you
to rule in his absence.

417
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:29,080
And rule you have.

418
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,420
Wisely, ably.

419
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,170
They see that.
They respect you.

420
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,580
Some may even
prefer you.

421
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes, they turned
their backs on Jon

422
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,420
when it was time
to retake Winterfell,

423
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,080
then they named him
their king,

424
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,960
and now they're ready
to turn their backs
on him again.

425
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,210
How far would you trust
men like that?

426
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:47,290
They're all
bloody wind vanes.

427
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,330
If they found out
that I wrote that letter,

428
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,830
a woman who's
already married

429
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,380
not one,
but two enemies
of her house...

430
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:57,420
By the time Jon comes back,
he'll have no army left.

431
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,210
Arya's not like them.

432
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,040
She's your sister.

433
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,830
You may have
disagreements,

434
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:07,290
but she would never
betray her family.

435
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:09,830
She would if she thought
I was going to betray Jon.

436
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,750
Is that
what she thinks?

437
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:13,670
I don't know
what she thinks.

438
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:15,710
I don't know her
anymore.

439
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,540
Perhaps Lady Brienne
could help.

440
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
She's sworn to protect
both of Catelyn Stark's girls,

441
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,250
is she not?

442
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,250
She is.

443
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,580
And if one of you
were planning to harm
the other in any way,

444
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,710
wouldn't she be
honor bound to intercede?

445
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,210
She would.

446
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,670
- Something I've always
wanted to know.
- All right.

447
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,920
How drunk were you
when you charged through
the breach on Pyke?

448
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,710
If I'm being honest,
I don't remember charging
through the breach.

449
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,250
Some of the lads
told me about it
the next morning.

450
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,630
Sounded like
a good scrap.

451
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,920
Aye.

452
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,210
It was
a proper scrap.

453
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,580
The ironborn thought
you were some kind of god,

454
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,920
the way you were waving
that flaming sword.

455
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:34,000
I thought you were
the bravest man I ever saw.

456
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,880
Just the drunkest.

457
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,080
Where's
the rest of them?

458
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,330
If we wait long enough,
we'll find out.

459
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,000
Run back to Eastwatch.

460
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,210
Get a raven to Daenerys,
tell her what's happened.

461
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,580
- I'm not leaving you.
- You're the fastest.
Go, now.

462
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,500
You're faster
without the hammer.
Give it.

463
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,630
Give it!

464
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,330
- Come on!
- Run!

465
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,830
Tormund:
Come on!

466
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,880
Stop!

467
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,630
Go!

468
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,670
What happened?

469
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,170
Where are the others?

470
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,380
Raven, we need
to send a raven.

471
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,170
Get the maester, now!

472
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,880
Thoros?

473
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,880
Thoros.

474
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,210
They say it's one
of the better ways to go.

475
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,750
Beric:
Lord of Light,
show us the way.

476
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,290
Come to us in our darkness
and lead Your servant
into the light.

477
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,670
We have to
burn his body.

478
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,080
We'll all be
close behind him

479
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,960
unless the Lord of Light
is kind enough to send us
a bit of fire.

480
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,500
Beric:
Lord of Light,

481
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,170
come to us
in our darkness,

482
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,880
for the night is dark
and full of terrors.

483
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,670
We'll all freeze soon.

484
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,790
And so will the water.

485
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,500
When you killed
the white walker,

486
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,380
almost all the dead
that followed it fell.

487
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,250
Why?

488
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,500
Maybe he was the one
who turned them.

489
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,880
We can go
for the walkers.

490
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,670
- Maybe we'll
stand a chance.
- Jon: No.

491
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:36,000
We need to take
that thing back with us.

492
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,630
Jon:
There's a raven flying
for Dragonstone now.

493
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,040
Daenerys is
our only chance.

494
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,000
No.
There's another.

495
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,040
Kill him.

496
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:54,880
Beric:
He turned them all.

497
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:00,420
You don't understand.

498
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,790
Beric:
The Lord
brought you back.

499
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,000
He brought me back.

500
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,080
No one else.
Just us.

501
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,460
Did He do it to watch us
freeze to death?

502
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,130
Careful, Beric.
You lost your priest.

503
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,920
This is your last life.

504
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,000
I've been
waiting for the end
for a long time.

505
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,670
Maybe the Lord
brought me here
to find it.

506
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,540
Every lord
I've ever met's
been a cunt.

507
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,420
Don't see why
the Lord of Light
should be any different.

508
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,960
Wolkan:
My lady.

509
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,170
My lady?

510
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,290
It's an invitation
to King's Landing.

511
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,630
My lady, you are
the Lady of Winterfell.

512
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:13,210
I am, and you will
represent my interests

513
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:14,790
at this gathering
as you see them.

514
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,170
They invited you.
They want you there.

515
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,710
I will not set foot
in King's Landing

516
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,290
while Cersei Lannister
is queen.

517
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,000
If they want
another Stark prisoner,

518
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,790
they can come
and take me.

519
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,540
Until then, I'll remain
where I belong.

520
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,460
I have work to do here.

521
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,080
It's not safe.

522
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,920
Ser Jaime
will be there.

523
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,500
You said he treated you
honorably before.

524
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,500
I'm not worried
about me.

525
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,670
It's not safe leaving you
with Littlefinger.

526
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,960
I have many guards
who would happily

527
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,420
imprison him
or behead him

528
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,790
whether or not
you're here.

529
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,000
And you trust
their loyalty?

530
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,670
You trust he hasn't been
speaking to them all
behind your back?

531
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,040
Let me at least
leave Podrick behind
to watch over you.

532
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,670
He has become
a competent swordsman--

533
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:07,130
I do not need
to be watched over
or minded or cared for.

534
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,380
I'm not a child,

535
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,290
I am the Lady of Winterfell,
and I am home.

536
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:13,330
This is the safest
place for me.

537
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,830
My lady,

538
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:19,710
I swore an oath
to protect you
and your sister.

539
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,880
- If I abandon you--
- The trip to King's Landing
is long, Lady Brienne,

540
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,420
and you won't be
traveling on summer roads.

541
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,540
The sooner you leave,
the better your chances
of making it on time.

542
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,380
Yes, my lady.

543
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,250
You can't.

544
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:00,130
The most important
person in the world

545
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:02,830
can't fly off
to the most dangerous
place in the world.

546
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,880
- Who else can?
- No one.

547
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,880
They knew the risks
when they left.

548
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,420
You can't win the throne
if you're dead.

549
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,960
You can't break the wheel
if you're dead.

550
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,250
So, what would
you have me do?

551
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,040
Nothing.

552
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,130
Sometimes nothing
is the hardest thing to do.

553
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,920
If you die,
we're all lost.

554
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,830
Everyone, everything.

555
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,500
You told me
to do nothing before
and I listened to you.

556
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:34,290
I'm not doing
nothing again.

557
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,130
Dumb cunt.

558
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,710
Oh, fuck.

559
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,790
Fuck it.

560
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:00,330
Yah!

561
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,040
Yah!

562
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:31,960
Fall back!

563
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,460
- Fall back!
- Tormund: Come on!

564
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:04,630
Help me!

565
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,210
Go!

566
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:17,710
Jon!

567
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,960
Go!

568
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,460
Go now! Leave!

569
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,330
Uncle Benjen!

570
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,330
How?

571
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,670
- You ride for the pass.
- Come with me.

572
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,630
There's no time.

573
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,500
Go!

574
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,790
We'll meet again,
Clegane.

575
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,130
Fucking hope not.

576
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,960
It's time to go,
Your Grace.

577
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,330
A bit longer.

578
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:41,210
Man:
Rider approaching!

579
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:51,920
Man:
Open the gate!

580
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:36,080
Not what
you're looking for?

581
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:41,250
I have hundreds of men
here at Winterfell,
all loyal to me.

582
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,750
They're not here now.

583
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:49,500
What are these?

584
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,920
My faces.

585
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,250
Where did
you get them?

586
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:59,500
In Braavos,
while I was training
to be a Faceless Man.

587
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,670
What does that mean?

588
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,170
Back in Braavos,

589
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:08,830
before I got
my first face,

590
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,170
there was a game
I used to play.

591
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:13,380
The Game of Faces.

592
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,170
It's simple--

593
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,670
I ask you a question
about yourself,

594
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:21,080
and you try to make lies
sound like the truth.

595
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:24,130
If you fool me,
you win.

596
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:27,790
If I catch a lie,
you lose.

597
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:30,000
Let's play.

598
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,080
I don't want to play.

599
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,880
How do you feel
about Jon being king?

600
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:40,040
Is there someone else
you think should rule
the North instead of him?

601
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,960
Those faces,
what are they?

602
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,330
You want to do
the asking?

603
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,380
Are you sure?

604
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,210
The Game of Faces
didn't turn out so well

605
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:51,960
for the last person
who asked me questions.

606
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,920
Tell me
what they are.

607
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:00,210
We both wanted
to be other people
when we were younger.

608
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,750
You wanted
to be a queen,

609
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:07,040
to sit next
to a handsome, young king
on the Iron Throne.

610
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:10,830
I wanted to be
a knight,

611
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:13,920
to pick up
a sword like Father
and go off to battle.

612
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:20,080
Neither of us got to be
that other person, did we?

613
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:23,710
The world doesn't
just let girls decide
what they're going to be.

614
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,710
But I can now.

615
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:29,830
With the faces,
I can choose.

616
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:32,130
I can become
someone else.

617
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,920
Speak in their voice,

618
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,540
live in their skin.

619
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,750
I could even
become you.

620
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,960
I wonder what
it would feel like

621
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,130
to wear
those pretty dresses...

622
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,330
to be the Lady
of Winterfell.

623
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:04,130
All I'd need
to find out...

624
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:07,330
is your face.

625
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,830
I'm sorry.

626
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:11,960
I'm so sorry.

627
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,830
I wish I could
take it back.

628
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:29,880
I wish
we'd never gone.

629
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:34,880
I don't.

630
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,880
If we hadn't gone,
I wouldn't have seen.

631
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,830
You have to see it
to know.

632
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,210
Now I know.

633
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,540
The dragons
are my children.

634
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,210
They're the only children
I'll ever have.

635
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:56,830
Do you understand?

636
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:07,040
We are going to destroy
the Night King and his army.

637
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:08,920
And we'll do it
together.

638
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,880
You have my word.

639
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,710
Thank you, Dany.

640
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,920
"Dany"?

641
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,580
Who was the last person
who called me that?

642
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:29,250
I'm not sure.
Was it my brother?

643
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,080
Mm, not the company
you want to keep.

644
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,790
All right.

645
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,880
Not "Dany."

646
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,080
How about "my queen"?

647
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:50,920
I'd, uh,
bend the knee, but...

648
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,080
What about those
who swore allegiance to you?

649
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,290
They'll all
come to see you
for what you are.

650
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,790
I hope I deserve it.

651
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:18,630
You do.

652
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:40,830
You should get
some rest.

653
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,040

The thrill will fade.

If we live that long.

Men without cocks.

Gold?

13
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,300
I spent my life
around soldiers.

14
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,420
What do you think
they spend that gold on?

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,630
Family.

00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,300
Not without a cock,
you don't.

17
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,470
Maybe it really is
all cocks in the end.

18
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,840
Yet, your brother
has chosen to side
with the cockless.

19
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,720
Yes, he's always been
a champion of the downtrodden.

20
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,670
I think we're about to be
the downtrodden.

Man:
Archers, stand tall!

Man #2: Cover that wall!

23
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:14,090
- How many people live here?
- A million, give or take.

24
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,220
That's more people
than the entire North
crammed into that.

25
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,380
Why would anyone
want to live that way?

26
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,840
There's more work
in the city.

27
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,050
And the brothels
are far superior.

28
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,420
Cersei:
Why isn't she with them?

29
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,590
Qyburn:
I'm afraid I don't know,
Your Grace.

30
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,760
No one has seen her.

31
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,420
And the rest of them?

32
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,670
They're on their way
to the Dragonpit now.

33
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,970
Including our brother?

34
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,760
Yes, Your Grace.

35
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,590
If anything goes wrong,

36
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,630
kill the silver-haired
bitch first,

37
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,920
then our brother,
then the bastard who
calls himself king.

38
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,970
The rest of them you can kill
in any order you see fit.

39
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,760
Come, Ser Gregor.

40
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,920
It's time for us
to meet our guests.

41
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,840
Missandei:
Why did they build it?

42
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,470
Dragons don't understand
the difference

43
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,670
between what is theirs
and what isn't.

44
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,340
Land, livestock,
children...

45
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,880
Letting them roam free
around a city was a problem.

46
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,670
I imagine it was
a sad joke at the end.

47
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,130
An entire arena
for a few sickly creatures
smaller than dogs.

48
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,630
But in the beginning,
when it was home to
Balerion the Dread,

49
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,010
it must have been
the most dangerous
place in the world.

50
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,340
Maybe it still is.

51
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,340
Welcome, my lords.

52
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,380
Your friends arrived
before you did.

53
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,260
I've been sent
to escort you all
to the meeting.

54
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,720
A pleasant surprise
in an unpleasant situation.

55
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,380
I never thought
I'd see you again,
my lord.

56
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,920
Supporting the enemy,
no less.

57
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,670
- Hard to blame you.
- Cersei will anyway.

58
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,380
I'm glad you're alive.

59
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,630
Bronn:
Come on!

60
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,090
You can suck
his magic cock later.

61
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,130
What's in there?

62
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:29,920
Fuck off.

63
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,260
I thought
you were dead.

64
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,420
Not yet.

65
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,760
You came pretty close.

66
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,720
I was only trying
to protect her.

67
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,010
You and me both.

68
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,920
She's alive.

69
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,090
Arya.

70
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,970
- Where?
- Winterfell.

71
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,970
Who's protecting her
if you're here?

72
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,470
The only one
that needs protecting

73
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,800
is the one that gets
in her way.

74
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,340
It won't be me.

75
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,550
Tyrion:
Here we are--

76
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,090
the heroes
of Blackwater Bay.

77
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,670
Strange place
for a reunion.

78
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,550
It is, my lord.

79
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,630
I don't think
I'm anyone's lord
anymore, Podrick.

80
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,220
Save the titles for
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

81
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,130
I'm sure your new queen
will be happy to
restore yours

82
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,590
if she ends up
on the throne.

83
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,720
You've been thinking
about our new queen?

84
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,050
Perhaps you've
been reconsidering
your allegiances.

85
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,090
Remember my offer--

86
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,510
whatever
they're paying you,
I'll pay double.

87
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,050
And that would be
double what now, exactly?

88
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,590
Don't you worry about me.
I'm doing all right.

89
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,920
- Looking after myself.
- Tyrion: Are you?

90
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,380
Helping me to arrange
this meeting

91
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,840
wasn't exactly looking
after yourself, was it?

92
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,630
You put yourself
at risk.

93
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,510
I put yourself at risk.
Important difference.

94
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,010
It's your head Queen Cersei's
offered a bag of gold for,
it's not mine.

95
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,800
Now, thanks to me,

96
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,010
she's got two traitors' heads
coming right through her door.

97
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,470
She can lop them both off
as soon as she gets tired

98
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,340
of the clever words that
pour out their pieholes.

99
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,550
All thanks to Ser Bronn
of the fucking Blackwater.

100
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,840
If that's not
looking after myself,
I don't know what is.

101
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,880
It's good
to see you again.

102
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,340
Yeah, you, too.

103
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,050
Anyone touches it,
I'll kill you first.

104
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,720
Come on, Pod.

105
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,220
Let's you and me
go have a drink

106
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,760
while the fancy folks
talk, eh?

107
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,800
I left this shit city

108
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,630
because I didn't
want to die in it.

109
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,920
Am I going to die
in this shit city?

110
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,090
You might.

111
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,510
And this is all
your idea.

112
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,840
Seems every bad idea
has some Lannister cunt
behind it.

113
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,010
And some Clegane cunt
to help them see it through.

114
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,720
Remember me?

115
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,630
Yeah, you do.

116
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,720
You're even fucking
uglier than I am now.

117
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,220
What did they do
to you?

118
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,550
Doesn't matter.

119
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,760
That's not how it ends
for you, brother.

120
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,010
You know who's
coming for you.

121
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,090
You've always known.

122
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,630
Where is she?

123
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,170
She'll be here soon.

124
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,420
Didn't travel with you?

125
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,220
No.

126
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,220
We've been here
for some time.

127
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,510
My apologies.

128
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,470
We are all
facing a unique--

129
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,510
Euron:
Theon!

130
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,420
I have your sister.

131
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,840
If you don't submit
to me here, now...

132
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,630
I'll kill her.

133
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,840
I think we ought to begin
with larger concerns.

134
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,050
Then why
are you talking?

135
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,260
You're the smallest
concern here.

136
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,510
Do you remember
when we discussed
dwarf jokes?

137
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,260
His wasn't even good.

138
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,590
He explained it
at the end.

139
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,130
Never explain.
It always ruins it.

140
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,630
We don't even
let your kind live

141
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,840
in the Iron Islands,
you know?

142
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,050
We kill you at birth.

143
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,090
An act of mercy
for the parents.

144
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,760
Perhaps you ought
to sit down.

145
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,220
Why?

146
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,420
Sit down or leave.

147
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:38,630
We are a group of people
who do not like one another,

148
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,170
as this recent
demonstration has shown.

149
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,970
We have suffered
at each other's hands.

150
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:48,340
We have lost people we love
at each other's hands.

151
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,630
If all we wanted
was more of the same,

152
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,880
there would be no need
for this gathering.

153
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,920
We are entirely capable
of waging war against
each other

154
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,630
without meeting
face-to-face.

155
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,510
So instead,
we should settle
our differences

156
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,170
and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

157
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,590
We all know
that will never happen.

158
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,970
Then why are we here?

159
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,340
This isn't about
living in harmony.

160
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,630
It's just
about living.

161
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,220
The same thing
is coming for all of us.

162
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,260
A general you can't
negotiate with.

163
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,010
An army that doesn't
leave corpses behind
on the battlefield.

164
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,590
Lord Tyrion tells me
a million people live
in this city.

165
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,010
They're about to become
a million more soldiers
in the Army of the Dead.

166
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,720
I imagine for most of them
it would be an improvement.

167
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,300
This is serious.

168
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,470
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.

169
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,300
I don't think
it's serious at all.

170
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,760
I think it's
another bad joke.

171
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,510
If my brother Jaime
has informed me correctly,

172
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,130
you're asking me
for a truce.

173
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,670
Yes.
That's all.

174
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,760
That's all?

175
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,720
Pull back my armies
and stand down

176
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,420
while you go
on your monster hunt.

177
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,010
Or while you solidify
and expand your position.

178
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:05,380
Hard for me
to know which it is
with my armies pulled back

179
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,050
until you return
and march on my  capital
with four times the men.

180
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,380
Your capital will be safe
until the northern threat
is dealt with.

181
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,090
You have my word.

182
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,220
The word of
a would-be usurper.

183
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,220
There is no conversation

184
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,260
that will erase
the last 50 years.

185
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,470
We have something
to show you.

186
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,550
We can destroy them
by burning them.

187
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,550
And we can destroy them
with dragonglass.

188
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,380
If we don't win
this fight,

189
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,380
then that is the fate
of every person in the world.

190
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,260
There is only one war
that matters--

191
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,590
the Great War.

192
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,090
And it is here.

193
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,420
Daenerys:
I didn't believe it
until I saw them.

194
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,090
I saw them all.

195
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,010
How many?

196
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,420
A hundred thousand,
at least.

197
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,630
Can they swim?

198
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,920
No.

199
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,300
Good.

200
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,800
I'm taking the Iron Fleet
back to the Iron Islands.

201
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,880
What are you
talking about?

202
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,800
I've been
around the world.

203
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,170
I've seen everything,
things you couldn't imagine,

204
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,630
and this...

205
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,420
this is the only thing
I've ever seen that
terrifies me.

206
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,670
I'm going back
to my island.

207
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,340
You should go
back to yours.

208
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,300
When winter's over,

209
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,970
we'll be the only ones
left alive.

210
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,470
Cersei:
He's right to be afraid.

211
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,420
And a coward to run.

212
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,670
If those things
come for us,

213
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,590
there will be
no kingdoms to rule.

214
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:03,010
Everything we suffered
will have been for nothing.

215
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,800
Everything we lost
will have been for nothing.

216
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,340
The crown accepts
your truce.

217
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,720
Until the dead are defeated,
they are the true enemy.

218
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,550
In return,
the King in the North
will extend this truce.

219
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
He will remain in the North
where he belongs.

220
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,670
He will not take up arms
against the Lannisters.

221
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,090
He will not
choose sides.

222
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:38,380
Daenerys:
Just the King
in the North?

223
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,840
Not me?

224
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,470
I would never
ask it of you.

225
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,050
You would never
agree to it.

226
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,550
And if you did,
I would trust you
even less than I do now.

227
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,800
I ask it only
of Ned Stark's son.

228
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,340
I know Ned Stark's son
will be true to his word.

229
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,300
I am true to my word.

230
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,050
Or I try to be.

231
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,760
That is why
I cannot give you
what you ask.

232
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,760
I cannot serve
two queens.

233
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,550
And I have already
pledged myself

234
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,300
to Queen Daenerys
of House Targaryen.

235
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,010
Then there is
nothing left to discuss.

236
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,010
The dead will come north first.
Enjoy dealing with them.

237
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,010
We will deal with
whatever is left of you.

238
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,130
Brienne:
Ser Jaime.

239
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,590
It's been good
to see you.

240
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,590
I imagine the next time
will be across a battlefield.

241
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,170
We both saw
what just happened.

242
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,920
We both saw
that... thing.

243
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,720
Yes, and I'm not
looking forward to
seeing more of them.

244
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,380
But I'm loyal
to the queen,

245
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,300
and you're loyal to Sansa
and her dolt brother.

246
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,420
Oh, fuck loyalty!

247
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,970
Fuck loyalty?

248
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,510
This goes beyond houses
and honor and oaths.

249
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,010
Talk to the queen.

250
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,010
And tell her what?

251
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,510
Davos:
I wish you hadn't
done that.

252
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,670
I'm grateful
for your loyalty,

253
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,760
but my dragon died
so that we could be here.

254
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,170
If it's all for nothing,

255
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,340
then he died
for nothing.

256
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,840
I know!

257
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,510
I'm pleased
you bent the knee
to our queen.

258
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,220
I would
have advised it,
had you asked.

259
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,170
But have you
ever considered

260
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,380
learning how to lie
every now and then?

261
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,380
Just a bit?

262
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,760
I'm not going to swear
an oath I can't uphold.

263
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,720
Talk about my father
if you want,

264
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,800
tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

265
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,880
But when enough people
make false promises,

266
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,050
words stop meaning
anything.

267
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,220
Then there
are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

268
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,970
And lies won't help us
in this fight.

269
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:34,050
Tyrion:
That is indeed a problem.

270
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,590
The more immediate problem
is that we're fucked.

271
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,220
Any ideas
as to how we might

272
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,220
change that state
of affairs?

273
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,050
Only one.

274
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,470
Everyone stays here,

275
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,260
and I go and talk
to my sister.

276
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,670
I didn't come all this way
to have my Hand murdered.

277
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,470
I don't want Cersei
to murder me either.

278
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,470
I could have stayed in my cell
and saved a great deal
of trouble.

279
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:01,510
Jon:
I did this.

280
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,010
- I should go.
- She'll definitely
murder you.

281
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:07,380
I go see
my sister alone.

282
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,380
Or we all go home

283
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,130
and we're right back
where we started.

284
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:18,340
- You spoke with her?
- At her until she
kicked me out.

285
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,420
She thinks
I was an idiot
to trust you.

286
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,550
A lot of people
seem to think that,
actually.

287
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,170
I'm about to step
into a room

288
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,970
with the most murderous
woman in the world

289
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,880
who's already tried
to kill me twice,
that I know of.

290
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,510
Who's an idiot?

291
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,380
I suppose we should
say goodbye,

292
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,970
one idiot to another.

293
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,800
I shouldn't
be surprised,
I suppose.

294
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,590
She's your kind
of woman--

295
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,130
a foreign whore
who doesn't know
her place.

296
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,920
A foreign whore
you can't abduct,
beat, or intimidate.

297
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,630
That must be
difficult for you.

298
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,090
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner,

299
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,010
- whom you've convinced
to bow down before her.
- I didn't know about that.

300
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,090
And now you've got them both
working towards the same goal,

301
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,220
the goal
you've worked towards
your entire life...

302
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,300
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- ...the destruction
of this family.

303
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,630
I am the one
preventing that
from happening.

304
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,170
Daenerys didn't want
to debate and negotiate.

305
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,630
She didn't want
to bring you words.

306
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,590
She wanted to bring you
fire and blood

307
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,720
until I advised her
otherwise.

308
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,510
I don't want
to destroy our family.

309
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,470
I never have.

310
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,920
You killed our father.

311
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,550
After he sentenced me
to death

312
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,130
for a crime
I didn't commit,
yes, I killed him.

313
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,800
Hate me for it
if you want.

314
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,130
I hate myself for it
in spite of what he was,

315
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,590
in spite of
what he did to me.

316
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,340
Oh, poor little man.

317
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,050
Your papa
was mean to you.

318
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,090
Do you have any idea
what you did when you
fired that crossbow?

319
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,920
You left us open.

320
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,510
You laid us bare
for the vultures,

321
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,050
and the vultures came
and tore us apart.

322
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:45,720
You may not
have killed Joffrey,

323
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,630
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

324
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:49,670
No one would've touched them
if Father was here.

325
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,260
- No one would have dared--
- I have never been more sorry
about anything.

326
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,970
I will not hear it,
not from you.

327
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,720
I will not hear it!

328
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,010
All right.

329
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,470
You love your family,

330
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,550
and I have
destroyed it.

331
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,300
I will always
be a threat.

332
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,630
So put an end to me.

333
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,670
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

334
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,420
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

335
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,760
If it weren't for me,

336
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,840
you'd have
two beautiful children.

337
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,010
I've thought
about killing you

338
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,670
more times
than I can count.

339
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,670
Do it!
Say the word.

340
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,590
I am more sorry
about the children
than you could ever know.

341
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,760
- I will not--
- I don't care.
I loved them.

342
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,630
You know I did.

343
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,130
You know it in your heart
if there's anything
left of it.

344
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,970
It doesn't matter.

345
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,550
Your love doesn't matter.
Your feelings don't matter.

346
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,720
I don't care
why you did what you did.

347
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,590
I only care
what it cost us.

348
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,970
It cost us our future.

349
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,760
If there's no future,
then why are we here?

350
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,760
Why did you
allow me to come?

351
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,800
Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

352
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,550
Yes, no,
not what you hoped for,

353
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,090
but you must have
hoped for something.

354
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,670
What did you hope for?

355
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:31,340
- To make Jon Snow
submit to your queen?
- Mm, not like this.

356
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,720
But eventually,
you want everyone
to bend the knee to her.

357
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,470
- Yes.
- Why?

358
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,050
Because I think

359
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,880
she will make the world
a better place.

360
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,800
You said she'd destroy
King's Landing.

361
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,920
She knows herself.

362
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,470
She chose an advisor

363
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,800
who would check
her worst impulses
instead of feeding them.

364
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
That's the difference
between you.

365
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,010
I don't care about
checking my worst impulses.

366
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,630
I don't care about
making the world
a better place.

367
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,420
Hang the world.

368
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,880
That thing
you dragged here,

369
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,340
I know what it is,
I know what it means.

370
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,550
And when it came at me,
I didn't think about
the world.

371
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,630
Not at all.

372
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,220
As soon as
it opened its mouth,

373
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,590
the world
disappeared for me,

374
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,720
right down
its black throat.

375
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,090
All I could think about
was keeping those
gnashing teeth

376
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,630
away from the ones
who matter most,

377
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,420
away from my family.

378
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,050
Maybe Euron Greyjoy
had the right idea.

379
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:25,840
Get on a boat,
take those who matter--

380
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,010
You're pregnant.

381
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:02,170
No one is less happy
about this than I am.

382
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,590
I know.

383
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,760
I respect
what you did.

384
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,090
Wish you hadn't done it,
but I respect it.

385
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,260
This place was the beginning
of the end for my family.

386
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,590
A dragon
is not a slave.

387
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,880
They were terrifying.

388
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,590
Extraordinary.

389
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,050
They filled people
with wonder and awe,

390
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,300
and we locked them
in here.

391
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,130
They wasted away.

392
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,630
They grew small.

393
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,260
And we grew small
as well.

394
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,170
We weren't extraordinary
without them.

395
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,010
We were just like
everyone else.

396
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,970
You're not like
everyone else.

397
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,300
And your family
hasn't seen its end.

398
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:20,090
You're still here.

399
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,630
I can't
have children.

400
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,220
Who told you that?

401
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,170
The witch who
murdered my husband.

402
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,380
Has it occurred to you
she might not have been

403
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,170
a reliable source
of information?

404
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:39,130
You were right
from the beginning.

405
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,340
If I had trusted you,
everything would
be different.

406
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,840
So, what now?

407
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,340
I can't forget what I saw
north of the Wall.

408
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,260
And I can't pretend
that Cersei

409
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,550
won't take back
half the country
the moment I march north.

410
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,170
It appears
Tyrion's assessment
was correct.

411
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,670
We're fucked.

412
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,920
My armies will not
stand down.

413
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,470
I will not pull them
back to the capital.

414
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,760
I will march them north
to fight alongside you
in the Great War.

415
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,760
The darkness
is coming for us all.

416
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,510
We'll face it together.

417
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,300
And when
the Great War is over,

418
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,630
perhaps you'll remember
I chose to help

419
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,090
with no promises
or assurances from
any of you.

420
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,510
I expect not.

421
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,670
Call our banners.

422
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,170
All of them.

423
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:59,420
Littlefinger:
It's not easy for ravens
to fly in these storms.

424
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,420
Perhaps Jon tried
to send word earlier.

425
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,840
No, this is
the way he is,

426
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,220
the way
he's always been.

427
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,840
He never asked for my opinion.
Why would he start now?

428
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,590
I can't believe he'd
surrender the Northern crown
without consulting you.

429
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:16,010
This is his writing,
his signature.

430
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:19,170
He pledged to fight
for Daenerys Targaryen.

431
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,260
He's bent the knee.

432
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:23,840
I've heard gossip

433
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,840
that the Dragon Queen
is quite beautiful.

434
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,050
What does that have to do
with anything?

435
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,090
Jon is young
and unmarried.

436
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,300
Daenerys is young
and unmarried.

437
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,260
You think he wants
to marry her?

438
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,510
An alliance
makes sense.

439
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,720
Together, they'd be
difficult to defeat.

440
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,340
He was named
King in the North.

441
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,170
He can be unnamed.

442
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:00,670
Even if I wanted to,
Arya would never go along.

443
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,510
She always loved Jon
far more than she ever
loved me,

444
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,720
and she'd kill anyone
who betrayed her family.

445
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
You are family, too.

446
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,300
Would Arya really murder
her own sister?

447
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,630
Do you know
what she is now?

448
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:19,010
Do you know what
the Faceless Men are?

449
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,220
Only by reputation.

450
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,380
They worship
the God of Death,
I believe.

451
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:27,010
I never trust
godly men.

452
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,510
They're killers.

453
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,380
And Arya
was one of them.

454
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,840
What do you think
she's after?

455
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,420
She's your sister.

456
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,550
You know her far better
than I ever could.

457
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:49,840
Sometimes
when I try to understand
a person's motives,

458
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,760
I play a little game.

459
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:56,260
I assume the worst.

460
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,090
What's the worst reason
they could possibly have

461
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:07,050
for saying what they say
and doing what they do?

462
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,260
Then I ask myself,

463
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,420
"How well does
that reason explain

464
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,380
what they say
and what they do?"

465
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,760
So, tell me--

466
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,300
what's the worst thing
she could want?

467
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,130
She could
want me dead

468
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,340
because she thinks
I wronged my family.

469
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,630
Why did she come
to Winterfell?

470
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,800
To kill me

471
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,630
for marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

472
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,630
Why did
she unearth the letter
Cersei made you write?

473
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,420
To provide proof
of my betrayals.

474
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,170
To provide justification
after she murders me.

475
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,840
And after
she murders you,

476
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,510
what does she become?

477
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,720
Lady of Winterfell.

478
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,670
If we have the Dothraki
ride hard on the kingsroad,

479
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:32,340
they'll arrive at Winterfell
within the fortnight.

480
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,840
And the Unsullied?

481
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,470
We can sail with them
to White Harbor,

482
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:38,170
meet the Dothraki here
on the kingsroad,

483
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,130
then ride together
to Winterfell.

484
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,380
Perhaps you should fly
to Winterfell, Your Grace.

485
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,880
You have many enemies
in the North.

486
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,130
Thousands fell
fighting your father.

487
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,840
All it takes
is one angry man
with a crossbow.

488
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,050
He'll see
your silver hair
on the kingsroad

489
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:58,090
and know that
one well-placed bolt
will make him a hero.

490
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,720
The man who killed
the conqueror.

491
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,050
Jon:
It's your decision,
Your Grace.

492
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:07,260
But if we're going to be
allies in this war,

493
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:11,340
it's important
for the Northerners
to see us as allies.

494
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,510
If we sail
to White Harbor together,

495
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:16,760
I think it sends
a better message.

496
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,970
I've not come
to conquer the North.

497
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,300
I'm coming to save
the North.

498
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,260
We sail together.

499
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,420
Jon.

500
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,920
Can I speak
with you?

501
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,380
All right.

502
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,840
What you did
in King's Landing,

503
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,970
what you said...

504
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:15,550
you could've
lied to Cersei

505
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,470
about bending the knee
to Daenerys.

506
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,920
You risked everything
to tell an enemy the truth.

507
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,300
We went down there
to make peace.

508
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,800
And it seems to me
we need to be honest
with each other

509
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,170
if we're going
to fight together.

510
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,170
You've always known
what was right.

511
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,970
Even when we were all
young and stupid,

512
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,470
you always knew.

513
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:48,720
Every step you take...

514
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:52,050
it's always
the right step.

515
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,170
It's not.

516
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,420
It may seem that way
from the outside,

517
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,840
but I promise you,
it's not true.

518
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,840
I've done
plenty of things
that I regret.

519
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,550
Not compared to me,
you haven't.

520
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:07,170
No.

521
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,800
Not compared to you.

522
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,670
I always wanted
to do the right thing.

523
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,420
Be the right
kind of person.

524
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,010
But I never knew
what that meant.

525
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,760
It always seemed
like there's...

526
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,260
like there was
an impossible choice
I had to make.

527
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,510
Stark or Greyjoy.

528
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,380
Our father was
more of a father to you
than yours ever was.

529
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,220
- He was.
- And you betrayed him.

530
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,090
Betrayed his memory.

531
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,050
I did.

532
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:06,840
But you never
lost him.

533
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,800
He's a part of you.

534
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,090
Just like
he's a part of me.

535
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,260
But the things
I've done...

536
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:22,720
It's not my place
to forgive you
for all of it.

537
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:29,300
But what I can
forgive,

538
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:30,720
I do.

539
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:39,260
You don't need
to choose.

540
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,550
You're a Greyjoy...

541
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,090
and you're a Stark.

542
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,720
When I was
Ramsay's prisoner,

543
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,760
Yara tried
to save me.

544
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,300
She's the only one

545
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,260
who tried to save me.

546
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,510
She needs me now.

547
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,300
So, why are you
still talking to me?

548
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,010
Harrag:
Load up.

549
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,630
Load up, lads.
Go on.

550
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,970
Tide's coming in.

551
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,670
All of us chose
to follow Yara.

552
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:08,970
We left
the Iron Islands
for Yara.

553
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:11,800
She would never
leave one of us behind.

554
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,380
We're not
leaving her behind.

555
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,840
Your sister's dead.

556
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,550
- She's not dead.
- She's dead.

557
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:22,420
Even if Euron hasn't
cut her throat yet,
she's dead.

558
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:27,550
- She's our queen.
- She's your sister,
and you left her to die.

559
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,050
I did.

560
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,300
I ran from my uncle.

561
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,720
I was a coward.

562
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,970
So, why in fuck's name
should we listen to you?

563
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:42,590
They say the dead
can't swim.

564
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:44,170
We're going
to sail east,

565
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:46,550
find a nice,
quiet island,

566
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,550
kill all the men,
and take their wives
for ourselves.

567
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,970
- We're done with all that.
- Who says we are?

568
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,880
Yara did.
She made a pledge.

569
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,970
We're going
to find her,

570
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:02,760
and we're going
to set her free.

571
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,300
Run away,
little Theon.

572
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,260
It's what
you do best.

573
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,090
Man:
He needs to shut
his mouth.

574
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,800
Man: Hey!

575
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,050
Man #2: Oh, yes!

576
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:39,800
- Man #3:
That's more like it.

577
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:57,630
Stay down...

578
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,420
or I'll kill you!

579
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:14,470
I said stay down
or I'll kill you!

580
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,050
Not for me.

581
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,800
For Yara!

582
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,220
Men:
Yara!

583
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,260
Have my sister brought
to the Great Hall.

584
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,510
Are you sure
you want to do this?

585
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,590
It's not what I want.
It's what honor demands.

586
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,510
And what does
honor demand?

587
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:22,380
That I defend my family
from those who would harm us.

588
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:26,010
That I defend the North
from those who would
betray us.

589
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,970
All right, then.

590
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,670
Get on with it.

591
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:37,670
You stand accused
of murder.

592
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,510
You stand accused
of treason.

593
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:43,300
How do you answer
these charges...

594
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,550
Lord Baelish?

595
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,840
My sister asked you
a question.

596
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,050
Lady Sansa,
forgive me...

597
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,510
I'm a bit confused.

598
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:16,800
Which charges
confuse you?

599
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,840
Let's start with
the simplest one--

600
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:21,420
you murdered our aunt,
Lysa Arryn.

601
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:24,300
You pushed her
through the Moon Door
and watched her fall.

602
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:26,170
Do you deny it?

603
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,720
I did it
to protect you.

604
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,760
You did it
to take power
in the Vale.

605
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,050
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

606
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:37,550
You gave Lysa Tears of Lys
to poison him.

607
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:38,590
Do you deny it?

608
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,090
Whatever your aunt
might have told you...

609
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:46,420
she was
a troubled woman.

610
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,050
She imagined enemies
everywhere.

611
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:51,420
You had Aunt Lysa send
a letter to our parents

612
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:53,920
telling them
it was the Lannisters
who murdered Jon Arryn

613
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,420
when, really,
it was you.

614
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,630
The conflict between
the Starks and the Lannisters,

615
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,130
it was you
who started it.

616
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,220
Do you deny it?

617
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:01,840
I know
of no such letter.

618
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,670
You conspired
with Cersei Lannister

619
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:07,380
and Joffrey Baratheon
to betray our father,
Ned Stark.

620
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,920
Thanks to your treachery,
he was imprisoned

621
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,380
and later executed
on false charges
of treason.

622
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,220
- Do you deny it?
- I deny it!

623
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,590
None of you were there
to see what happened.

624
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:21,550
None of you
knows the truth.

625
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,470
You held a knife
to his throat.

626
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:31,300
You said,
"I did warn you
not the trust me."

627
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:39,300
You told our mother
this knife belonged
to Tyrion Lannister.

628
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,510
But that was another
one of your lies.

629
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,340
It was yours.

630
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:52,380
Lady Sansa,
I have known you
since you were a girl.

631
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,050
- I've protected you.
- Protected me?

632
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:57,170
By selling me
to the Boltons?

633
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,840
If we could
speak alone,

634
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,380
I can explain
everything.

635
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:07,720
Sometimes when
I'm trying to understand
a person's motives,

636
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,300
I play a little game.

637
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,970
I assume the worst.

638
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,260
What's the worst
reason you have

639
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,170
for turning me
against my sister?

640
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,090
That's what you do,
isn't it?

641
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:22,920
That's what
you've always done--

642
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,760
turn family
against family,

643
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,670
turn sister
against sister.

644
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:28,880
That's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa,

645
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,090
and that's what
you tried to do to us.

646
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:32,420
Sansa, please.

647
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,260
I'm a slow learner,
it's true.

648
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,720
But I learn.

649
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,970
Give me a chance
to defend myself.

650
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:41,260
I deserve that.

651
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:48,670
I am Lord Protector
of the Vale

652
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:51,050
and I command you
to escort me safely
back to the Eyrie.

653
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,340
I think not.

654
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,340
Sansa, I beg you!

655
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,880
I loved your mother
since the time
I was a boy.

656
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:03,670
And yet,
you betrayed her.

657
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:08,880
I loved you.

658
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,510
More than anyone.

659
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:13,420
And yet,
you betrayed me.

660
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:17,800
When you brought me
back to Winterfell,

661
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,340
you told me
there's no justice
in the world,

662
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,550
not unless
we make it.

663
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:28,970
Thank you for all
your many lessons,
Lord Baelish.

664
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:31,260
I will never
forget them.

665
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:35,880
Sansa!

666
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,090
I...

667
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:08,630
Jaime:
Our men in King's Landing

668
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,300
will march north
in three days' time.

669
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,670
Man:
It'll take us
a fortnight

670
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:13,010
just to gather supplies
for the train.

671
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,550
Jaime:
We don't have
a fortnight.

672
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:16,550
If the North falls, we fall.
Three days.

673
00:59:16,550 --> 00:59:18,090
The remaining forces
in the Westerlands

674
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,800
will take
the river road east.

675
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,340
We'll meet at
Lord Harroway's Town

676
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:23,340
and march together
to Winterfell.

677
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,510
Ser Jaime.

678
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:27,010
Your Grace.

679
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:29,470
My lords,
I need a moment
with my brother.

680
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:32,920
Men:
Your Grace.

681
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:39,970
- What are you doing?
- Preparing the expedition
north.

682
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:42,550
Expedition north?

683
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:45,840
I always knew you were
the stupidest Lannister.

684
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,510
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

685
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:50,630
and you want to fight
alongside them?

686
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,590
Are you a traitor
or an idiot?

687
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,550
You pledged our forces
to fight our common enemy--

688
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:56,010
I'll say whatever
I need to say

689
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,720
to ensure the survival
of our house.

690
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,470
You expect me
to trust the man
who murdered our father?

691
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:04,050
You expect me
to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum,

692
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:05,550
to fight for
the Dragon Queen?

693
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,470
You saw it
with your own eyes.

694
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:09,840
You saw a dead man
trying to kill us.

695
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,670
I saw it burn.

696
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,510
If dragons
can't stop them,

697
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:16,550
if Dothraki and Unsullied
and Northmen can't stop them,

698
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,550
how will our armies
make a difference?

699
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,550
This isn't about
noble houses,

700
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,670
this is about
the living and the dead!

701
01:00:22,670 --> 01:00:24,720
And I intend to stay
amongst the living.

702
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,920
Let the Stark boy
and his new queen
defend the North.

703
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,130
We stay here
where we've always been.

704
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,670
I made a promise.

705
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,260
Our child
will rule Westeros.

706
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:43,130
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

707
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:44,720
The monsters are real.

708
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,840
The white walkers,

709
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,090
the dragons,
the Dothraki screamers--

710
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:53,090
all the frightening stories
we heard when we were young,
they're all real.

711
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:54,800
So be it.

712
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:56,920
Let the monsters
kill each other.

713
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,170
And while they battle
in the North,

714
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:01,590
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

715
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:04,380
- And then what?
- And then we rule.

716
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,300
When the fighting
in the North is over,
someone wins.

717
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,470
You understand that,
don't you?

718
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,970
If the dead win,
they march south
and kill us all.

719
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:16,050
If the living win,
and we've betrayed them,

720
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:18,010
they march south
and kill us all!

721
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:21,010
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

722
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,420
Most of them
will die in the North.

723
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,010
I faced them
in the field.

724
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:26,550
We can't beat them.
We can't beat their dragons.

725
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,090
How many dragons
did you see at the pit?

726
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:30,090
- Two.
- What happened
to the third?

727
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:32,590
For all we know,
it's guarding her fleet!

728
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:35,920
She came here
with her dragons and her
Dothraki and her Unsullied.

729
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,720
She came here to show us
all her power.

730
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,760
No, something happened.
The dragons are vulnerable.

731
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,300
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

732
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,130
We don't have the support
of the other houses!

733
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:48,800
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

734
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:54,760
You should've listened more
when Father spoke about
the importance of gold.

735
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,920
Oh, I know
it's boring for you.

736
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,550
You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight.

737
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,130
But I listened,
I learned.

738
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:07,130
Highgarden bought us
the most powerful army
in Essos--

739
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,920
the Golden Company.

740
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,630
20,000 men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

741
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:14,300
The Golden Company
is not here.

742
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:15,670
They're in Essos.

743
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:19,630
How is a mercenary company
in Essos going to help us?

744
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:22,130
Do you really think
Euron Greyjoy turned tail

745
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:23,760
and sailed back
to the Iron Islands?

746
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,260
Do you think
he abandoned

747
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:29,510
the chance to marry
the queen?

748
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:31,840
No one walks away
from me.

749
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:35,340
He's sailing with
his fleet to Essos.

750
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:37,420
He's going to ferry
the Golden Company back here

751
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,970
to help us win
the war for Westeros.

752
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:44,670
You plotted
with Euron Greyjoy
without telling me,

753
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:46,510
the commander
of your armies?

754
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:49,130
And you conspired
with Tyrion,

755
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:50,510
the man who murdered
our father,

756
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:51,840
without telling me,
your queen.

757
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,300
I didn't conspire
with him.

758
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:55,170
You met with him in secret
without my consent.

759
01:02:55,170 --> 01:02:57,170
You planned to promote
my enemies' interests.

760
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:59,470
That  is the definition
of conspiracy.

761
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:01,840
I pledged
to ride north.

762
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,670
I intend to honor
that pledge.

763
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:05,880
- And that
will be treason.
- Treason?

764
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,130
Disobeying
your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

765
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:09,470
What would you
call it?

766
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:13,340
Doesn't matter
what I'd call it.

767
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,050
I told you no one
walks away from me.

768
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,920
Are you going to
order him to kill me?

769
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:32,010
I'm the only one
you have left.

770
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:34,470
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

771
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:36,220
It's just
me and you now.

772
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,220
There's one more
yet to come.

773
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,220
Give the order, then.

774
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:04,300
I don't
believe you.

775
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:54,720
Come in.

776
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,170
Samwell Tarly.

777
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:02,380
I wasn't sure
if you'd remember me.

778
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:04,220
I remember everything.

779
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:14,550
You helped us
get beyond the Wall.

780
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:17,090
- You're a good man.
- Oh, well, thank you,

781
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,720
but, um, I'm not sure
that I am.

782
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,050
What happened to you
beyond the Wall?

783
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:29,050
I became
the Three-Eyed Raven.

784
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:31,760
Oh!

785
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:37,420
I don't know
what that means.

786
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,170
I can see things
that happened in the past.

787
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:44,260
I can see things
happening now

788
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,760
all over the world.

789
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:49,590
Why did you come
to Winterfell?

790
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,260
Um...

791
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,630
Jon's the one to lead
the fight against the dead.

792
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:58,720
I know he is.

793
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,670
But he can't
do it alone,

794
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:03,550
so I've come here
to help him.

795
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:06,420
He's on his way
back to Winterfell

796
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:08,050
with Daenerys Targaryen.

797
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:12,260
You--
you saw this in--

798
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,920
in a vision?

799
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,130
Oh.

800
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,130
He needs to know
the truth.

801
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:25,670
The truth
about what?

802
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,470
About himself.

803
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:31,010
No one knows.
No one but me.

804
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:33,970
Jon isn't really
my father's son.

805
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:38,130
He's the son
of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

806
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:41,970
He was born
in a tower in Dorne.

807
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,420
His last name
isn't really Snow,

808
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:45,300
it's Sand.

809
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,670
It's not.

810
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:52,800
Dornish bastards
are named Sand.

811
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:56,420
At the Citadel, I transcribed
a High Septon's diary.

812
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:59,170
He annulled Rhaegar's
marriage to Elia.

813
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:03,880
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

814
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:06,630
Are you certain?

815
01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:09,340
It's what the High Septon
wrote in his private diary.

816
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,170
I don't know
why he'd lie.

817
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:15,550
Is this something
you can see?

818
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,840
Rhaegar and Lyanna:
Father, Smith, Warrior,

819
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:25,720
Mother, Maiden,
Crone, Stranger.

820
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:29,510
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

821
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:33,840
from this day
until the end of my days.

822
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,970
Bran's voice:
Robert's Rebellion
was built on a lie.

823
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:42,220
Rhaegar didn't
kidnap my aunt or rape her.

824
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,340
He loved her.

825
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:02,720
And she loved him.

826
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,090
Bran's voice: And Jon...

827
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:35,920
Jon's real name...

828
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:42,260
His name
is Aegon Targaryen.

829
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,470
You have
to protect him.

830
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:47,880
Promise me, Ned.

831
01:10:10,670 --> 01:10:12,970
Bran's voice:
He's never been a bastard.

832
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,590
Bran's voice:
He's the heir to
the Iron Throne.

833
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:36,130
Bran's voice:
He needs to know.

834
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:41,130
We need to tell him.

835
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:54,170
Are you
all right?

836
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:56,090
It's just strange.

837
01:10:56,090 --> 01:11:00,050
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

838
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,550
You did
the right thing.

839
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:08,090
You  did it.

840
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,920
I'm just
the executioner.

841
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,670
You passed
the sentence.

842
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,670
You're the Lady
of Winterfell.

843
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:18,050
Does that bother you?

844
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:23,510
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

845
01:11:24,970 --> 01:11:26,470
So I had to be
something else.

846
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:31,420
I never could have survived
what you survived.

847
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,760
You would have.

848
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,760
You're the strongest
person I know.

849
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,380
I believe
that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

850
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:47,760
Well, don't get
used to it.

851
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,010
You're still
very strange
and annoying.

852
01:11:56,510 --> 01:11:58,510
"In winter, we must
protect ourselves.

853
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:02,090
Look after
one another."

854
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,920
Father.

855
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:13,220
"When the snows fall
and the white winds blow,

856
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,170
the lone wolf dies,

857
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:17,630
but the pack survives."

858
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:25,920
I miss him.

859
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:30,760
Me, too.

860
01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,510
Beric:
It's a long way down.

861
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:58,340
Yeah.
The crows keep telling me
I'll get used to it.

862
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:10,130
Man:
I can see movement...

863
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:12,840
Watch, on the tree line!

864
01:14:13,970 --> 01:14:15,670
Man #2:
What is it?

865
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:47,970
Come on!

866
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:51,800
Run! Run!
